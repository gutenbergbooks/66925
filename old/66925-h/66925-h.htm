<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>


<p class="center">(TO BE READ)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Dictionary says that a Preface is something
spoken before. Usually it gives the author
an opportunity to talk about himself. Some
authors talk very much, especially about themselves,
in their Preface. Mr. George Bernard
Shaw writes more Preface than Book, and Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier simply uses the Book as an excuse
for the Preface. But you do not need to worry,
as you will not read either of them for a very
long time.</p>

<p>My Preface is going to be different. It is
about something that comes at the end and not
the beginning; furthermore, I am not going to
talk about myself.</p>

<p>Of course you do not know what in the world
I am driving at; I will come at once to the point.
I had all but finished the stories of Lady Rumdidoodledum&#8217;s
children when I received the following
letter. I have a pretty good idea that
&#8220;L. H. D.&#8221; is no other than the Child-Person
for whom Lady Rumdidoodledum winked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. S. B. Dinkelspiel</span>,<br />
<br />
<span class="gap">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor to inform you that Mrs.
Sherman is the mother of a lovely new baby
daughter, born this evening. She is to be christened
&#8216;Margaret,&#8217; but will be known to her friends
(of whom I trust you will be among the number)
as &#8216;Midge.&#8217; Liza and Martha Mary are delighted
over the new arrival&mdash;the boys have not yet seen
the little lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoping that she will prove as welcome to you
as to the rest of her very devoted family, I am,
sir,</p>

<p><span class="gap">&#8220;Your very obedient servant and humble collaborator,</span></p>

<p class="right">L. H. D.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Planet Venus.</p>
</div>

<p>A day or so later, a thick envelope came
through the mail for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it,&#8221; said I to myself, &#8220;another of my stories
rejected by a heartless editor?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not! It was the story of &#8220;Midge,&#8221; written
by &#8220;L. H. D.,&#8221; and it came just in time, for
I had been having a miserable hour seeking a
last chapter for the book, and here one fell&mdash;I
might say&mdash;out of the sunny sky.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>


<p class="center">IN WHICH WE MEET FLIP, ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUPPOSED<br />
TO BE A SECRET</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> on the edge of the Poppy Field there is a
very large, wide lake; the largest lake you have ever
seen. Of course there are deeper lakes across the
mountains where you have never been, but Poppy
Lake is quite deep enough. When you turn your
back and lean down and look between your legs so
that everything is upside-down, it looks still larger;
almost as big as the sky and just as blue. Right on
the shore, tied to a willow tree, is a wonderful green
boat with two oars when you wish to go exploring
alone, and four if you intend to take a crew with
you.</p>

<p>John usually went alone, because crews never
know their place and want to be Captain if they
are men, or always talk about fairies and husbands
and silly trifles if they are women. There is of
course only one woman and she is Martha Mary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
you see, Liza is only three years old and can&#8217;t
really be called a woman. The fact is, John prefers
traveling with Liza to any of the others.
She respects John very much and will not mind
anyone else&mdash;not even Nurse Huggins. John is
quite a famous traveler; there have been times
when he would sit at the helm of his good ship and
Liza would sit on the deck on her legs and fold
her arms and watch the Captain with very large,
grey eyes. Then John would cough and bow to
her and say in a voice almost as loud as Butcher
Levy&#8217;s:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does your Ladyship desire to sail
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Liza would say, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; which is not an answer
at all.</p>

<p>Then John would pick up the oars and row with
all his might, just as though the ship were not
tied to the willow tree. Right into the ocean they
would go. Sometimes they could travel almost
as far as England before Nurse Huggins called
them to come to tea. Nurse Huggins always
called just as they were about to get somewhere.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Martha Mary thought it silly for John to play
with Liza so much; you see, John was at least
twelve and Martha Mary was ten, so they were
much more fitted for each other than John and
Liza. So Martha Mary would come down to the
Lake and call to John and he would put his hands
to his ears and shout:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you. I&#8217;m miles and miles
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Martha Mary would stamp her foot, and
go away to find Edward Lee Sherman, who was
seven years old and her youngest brother, and
Walter, who was eight and almost Edward&#8217;s twin.
You see, the Sherman family was quite a large
one; first, there was John and then Martha Mary;
then Walter and Edward Lee, and then Liza.
But that wasn&#8217;t all. Nurse Huggins was a very
important member of the family, and there was
Agnes, the cook, and Dawson, the gardener, and
Mother Dear, who looked almost like a girl herself,
sometimes, and Father, who was terribly old
and had brown whiskers and the softest grey eyes,
just like Liza&#8217;s. And I almost forgot Hermit.
He was the huge St. Bernard and next to Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Dear, the most important member of the household.
No one knew just how old Hermit was.
But Captain John was quite sure that the very
first thing he heard when he opened his eyes in
this world was Hermit&#8217;s welcoming bark. That
was twelve years ago, and twelve is old for a
dog.</p>

<p>And&mdash;there was one other. He was supposed
to be a secret, but I never could keep a secret
and, as long as I have told about Hermit and
Hermit found him, I might as well tell. He was
Flip. That wasn&#8217;t his real name, but Liza could
not say Philip, so she called him Flip. And after
a while everyone else did, too. This is the way
we found him. You see, Hermit did not come
home for dinner one night and everyone was very
much frightened. They went all over the poppy
field calling him, but he didn&#8217;t come. It grew
so late that the stars came out, so Mother Dear
put Liza and Edward Lee to bed. She was very
quiet and not at all smily when she tucked them
in, because she was worried about Hermit. For
hours and hours John and Father and Gardener
Dawson hunted with yellow lanterns; they called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and whistled, but Hermit did not come. So
they went to bed, and Father said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the old boy alone. He is sure to come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father always did know everything!</p>

<p>The first thing next morning, all the family
hurried out to the garden, but there was no Hermit.
Father went East and John went West
and all the others scattered in different directions,
leaving Liza all alone to take care of Mother
Dear. But Mother Dear was not at all good
company; she wouldn&#8217;t crawl on the floor and
she wouldn&#8217;t smile, so Liza slipped away, very
unhappy. She took her Nigger Doll, Samuel,
and walked way, way off, down into the Lily
Place where the frogs live. And right there,
perfectly happy and grinning, was Hermit&mdash;all
muddy and with his tongue hanging out as though
he had been running and was out of breath. Next
to him, sprawled out on the grass, with one foot
stuck up in the air and a cap on his toe, was a
man and he was talking to Hermit. Liza did not
pay any attention to him; she just jumped on
Hermit&#8217;s back and rubbed her face in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
neck. The man was very much surprised. He
sat up, brushed the dirt off of his trousers, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Liza laughed at him and pulled Hermit&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;Good morning,&#8217;&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>That sort of frightened Liza, so she jumped up
and ran off to find John, with Hermit bounding
after her. Just then John came through the trees,
followed by Edward Lee and Walter and Martha
Mary. They hugged Hermit to show how glad
they were to see him, and then Liza took them
to the new man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are you the whole family?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are the Shermans,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Edward Lee, &#8220;and we wish you
would go away so that we could play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward Lee!&#8221; Martha Mary whispered.
&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be impolite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed. &#8220;Please,&#8221; said he, &#8220;may I
play, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too old,&#8221; said Walter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>John did not mean to have any unfairness.
&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The man held his fingers to his lips. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
secret. Folks say I&#8217;m twenty-three,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But they really don&#8217;t know. The fact is I&#8217;m
only twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swear it and hope to die?&#8221; demanded John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hope to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I have to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;If you want to be
twelve, we will let you. Please, what can you
play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is lovely,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
play &#8216;Robinhood.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll be Robinhood,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll be Little John,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Little John,&#8221; said Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not. I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Edward Lee. &#8220;Then I don&#8217;t
want to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man frowned. &#8220;See here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
can&#8217;t both be Little John. Suppose we play
something else. Suppose I tell you a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know any?&#8221; Martha Mary asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dozens of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice! I think I shall like you. What is
your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flip,&#8221; said Liza, and that is how he got his
name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Mother Dear had joined Father.
They hunted high and low for Hermit and for
the children, too, for by this time Mother was
growing really and truly frightened. All of a
sudden they heard Edward Lee laughing. To
the Lily Place they ran, and there&mdash;through the
trees&mdash;guess what they saw! There was Flip
leaning against a fat old oak tree, with one leg
up in the air and his cap on his toe. Liza was sitting
on the knee of the leg that wasn&#8217;t up in the
air, while Martha Mary was lying on the ground
on her stomach, weaving buttercups. John and
Walter were sitting up in the tree; Edward Lee
was on Hermit&#8217;s back, and Flip was telling his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
story. So Mother Dear sat down very quietly
and pulled Father after her. She leaned against
his shoulder and closed her eyes, while Father
smoothed her hair. And they listened to the
story, too, and this was it:</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>IN WHICH PETER SPILLS THE DEW OUT OF HIS<br />
POCKET AND IT CAUSES A GREAT DEAL OF<br />
BOTHER, BUT MR. SMITH, WHO IS THE KING<br />
OF FAIRIES, PUTS AN END TO THE TROUBLE</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Peter</span> sat on a blade of wheat and swung
backwards and forwards and up and down in the
wind, till his feet were higher than his head and
all the dewdrops spilled out of his pocket. I don&#8217;t
suppose you have ever seen Peter. He is about
this big&mdash;that is, as big as a red-headed match&mdash;and
he has little thin wings made out of the fuzz
that grows on the cowslips. Peter has red hair,
too, just like the match, and he is freckled, but
one can never see the freckles because they are
so small. In ways, Peter is a very wonderful boy.
You see, he can carry dewdrops in his pocket
(when he doesn&#8217;t spill them) and he skips around
the garden just before the stars go to bed putting
a dewdrop on every flower, just as a mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
cat would bathe her kitten. Peter likes his work;
he knew that every boy has to do something worth
while, so he chose the work that was the most
fun. Of course it is fun to bathe flowers. They
look so bright and sunshiny when they have their
drop of dew, just as your face does when Nurse
What-do-you-call-her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nurse Huggins, please,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nurse Huggins rubs soap on it and in your
eyes. So on this particular May morning Peter
sat on the piece of wavy wheat and waited for
the biggest and loveliest Mother star, Mrs. Rumdidoodledum,
to go away, so that he could go to
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, when Mrs. Rumdidoodledum had
gone to bed and the sky grew pink like the eyes
of Fluffytail, the white rabbit, Rosemary, who
was the queen of the flower fairies, came out and
clapped her hands to set all the morning elves to
work. First, Mr. James, the butler fairy, appeared
and pulled all of the dark-cloud curtains
out of the sky. Then a hundred and three golden
fairies tied daisy ropes to the sun and pulled him
up over the hill. Lastly Nurse Agnes, the fattest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
fairy you ever saw, went around and opened
all the flowers&#8217; eyes. Then everyone stood still
and waited for Peter to come down and wash
them. Of course the stupid Peter couldn&#8217;t, because
he had swung too high and spilled all the
dewdrops. At this, Queen Rosemary was terribly
angry&mdash;which wasn&#8217;t very bad, because the
fairies have all been well trained and never lose
their tempers. But she said Peter would have
to be punished. What do you think Queen Rosemary
did? She led Peter down to the red rosebush,
tied him to it with a piece of green grass,
and left him there for ever and ever so long. Next
morning, when Nurse Agnes had opened all the
flower children&#8217;s eyes, they waited for Peter to
come and wash them, but he couldn&#8217;t, because he
was tied up. The flower children were glad, because
they didn&#8217;t very much like to be washed,
either; it was such a nuisance to get the dewdrops
in their eyes and have them burn. You see,
flower children are just as silly as other children
when they are silly, and just as pretty and happy
when they are bright. So they went without washing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
all that day, and when Mr. James, the butler,
pulled the cloud curtains into the sky that night
the children were all tired and in bad humor, just
like you when you are dirty. They didn&#8217;t sleep
very well and they had queer dreams, and Midge,
the violet baby, woke up and cried three times and
kept everyone else awake. Then, the next morning,
when the hundred and three small wood
sprites went to pull up the sun, he came up
frowning. He looked at all the flower children
and it spoiled his pleasure to see how dirty and
cross they were. So he simply refused to shine
at all, but went behind a miserable black cloud
that Butler James had forgotten. There he
sulked all day. When they had no sun to brighten
them, the flower children all fell sick and faded;
even sulphur and molasses would not help them,
for in that way they were different from you.
You see, things were in a very bad way in the
flower garden. The flower children were so sickly
that the bees would not come to them for honey,
because it had become too thin. The sun hid away
day after day and refused to shine and there were
large black clouds that frightened everyone. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
ground got hard and stiff and squeezed the flowers
terribly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Rosemary became very much worried,
because she had to keep the flower children well
and at the same time punish Peter. So she
thought and thought and could not make up
her mind what to do. Then along came Mr.
Smith. You know, of course, that Mr. Smith is
the king of the fairies and he rides on the Southeast
Wind. He said to his wife:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The flower children look very sickly and the
sky is dark. What is the trouble, my dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told him all the confusion she had had,
but he laughed, because he was a man, and such
things never bother men. He jumped on the
Southeast Wind again and rushed up, up, right
into the clouds and broke them to small pieces.
Of course, when the clouds were all broken, the
rain fell out of them and all over the flower children.
And then&mdash;it was just like eating chocolate
cake, it was so nice. The flower children
were washed and became bright; the sun came out
because he was glad; the bees came buzzing
around again, and all the world was happy. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Queen Rosemary, on her throne in the sweetpeas,
was pleased, so she forgave Peter for spilling the
dewdrops. She told him, though, that whenever
he was bad in the future she would tie him up,
because she could count on the Southeast Wind
to bring rain and do Peter&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you see, whenever the sky grows black
and the flowers look sickly and the sun hides,
you may know that Peter has been misbehaving
and cannot wash the children. But you must not
mind, because the rain is sure to come to do his
work, and there is always sunshine after the
rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Flip had finished his story Mother Dear
hugged Father and whispered, &#8220;Who in the world
is this wonderful boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not say it very loud, but Flip heard
her and got up, with his cap in his hand, and
almost spilled Liza. He bowed and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t really wonderful. Stories like that
always happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ridiculous!&#8221; said Father, in a very stern
way. &#8220;Who are you? Where did you come
from?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m Flip, Liza says,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;and
so I must be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mother Dear,&#8221; said Martha Mary.
&#8220;He is nice, and Liza found him. Do you think
he might stay for tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell more stories before bedtime,&#8221; said
Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he found Hermit,&#8221; said Liza.</p>

<p>Mother Dear whispered something to Father
that no one else heard. Then Father said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, go up to the house and wait for
us. We will ask Flip if he will stay this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children went rather slowly, for they were
anxious to hear what was going to happen. It
must have been exciting, for ten minutes later
Mother Dear came to the veranda smiling, and
Flip&#8217;s eyes were all shiny, and Father was in the
best of humor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Babes,&#8221; said Mother Dear, &#8220;would you like
Flip to stay here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All evening?&#8221; asked Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Much longer. As long as he wishes to.
Perhaps always.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>You should have heard the children shout.
They hugged Mother Dear and hugged Father till
his hair was all mussed and danced about Flip
until he was all red; but Flip was easily embarrassed.
Finally Father said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence,&#8221; in an awesome tone, and added:
&#8220;Philip is going to stay to work about the place
and do chores and care for the flowers&mdash;AND tell
you stories when you are half-way good and he
feels like it. So you had better be good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away went the children to tell the wonderful
news to Nurse Huggins, all excepting Martha
Mary, who was rather curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Please, who is
Flip and how did you get Father to let him
stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flip is a very fine boy,&#8221; said Mother, &#8220;and
he has aspirations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are aspirations?&#8221; asked Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;You explain to her, Father,&#8221; said Mother
Dear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is this way,&#8221; said Father. &#8220;Aspirations
are like&mdash;like&mdash;now let me see&mdash;you
know&mdash;&mdash; Oh! You tell her, Mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;Why, it is simple, Dear,&#8221; said Mother. &#8220;Aspirations&mdash;&mdash; Flip!
Explain to Martha Mary
what aspirations are.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Flip had followed the other children, to be
introduced to Cook and Nurse Huggins, so
Martha Mary did not find out for ages and ages
why Flip had aspirations or what they were.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>IN WHICH WE BEGIN TO REALIZE HOW CONVENIENT<br />
IT IS TO HAVE A PERSON LIKE FLIP ABOUT<br />
THE PLACE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS NOTHING<br />
MUCH TO DO; ALSO WE HEAR OF MR. MORIARITY<br />
AND THE FAIRY WHO DID NOT HAVE A<br />
RED CHIN BEARD AND A BALD HEAD</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was really quite surprising to learn how
easily Flip could be depended upon. When it
rained, Martha Mary would only need to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, do you think we might have a story?&#8221;
And Flip would lead the way to the fireplace
and, before you half knew it, you were in the
middle of a delightful story. Or Liza might
tumble into the ash can and hurt her nose. She
would cry dreadfully&mdash;and Flip would cure the
damage with a story. John might go sailing on
the lake Ocean and leave no one to be Captain
of the land army. Away the army&mdash;Martha
Mary, Walter, Edward Lee, and Liza&mdash;would go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to Flip for sympathy&mdash;and Flip&#8217;s sympathy would
be a story. Best of all were the stories he told
in the Runaway Place where the poppies grew,
lying on a small stack of hay, with his cap on his
toe. There were so many told there that I hardly
know which to tell to you first. Perhaps you
would like the one about Mr. Moriarity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you know,&#8221; said Flip, &#8220;that every
child has a fairy just as there is a fairy for
every flower. But what I am going to tell you
is much more surprising than that. Every
grown-up, no matter how big or important he
may be, has just as nice a fairy in charge of his
affairs. The fairies of the grown-ups do not show
themselves nearly as often as flowers or children
fairies. You see, grown-ups have not the time
to think of such things. Furthermore, they are
usually ashamed to recognize them, and of course
the fairies are proud and will not go where they
are not wanted. Would you believe that Father
has a perfectly lovely fairy and there is another
little, golden-winged one that belongs to Mother
Dear? Well, there is! I have never seen them,
but there must be. You see, Fairies are dreams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and everybody has dreams; even Mr. Moriarity, the
green grocer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Moriarity&#8217;s fairy was the prettiest little
fairy you have ever seen. Guess why? Because
fairies do not take after their owners&#8217; looks. If
they did, Mr. Moriarity&#8217;s fairy would have to be
a little red-faced creature with a red chin beard
and watery blue eyes and a bald head. But fairies
take after their owners&#8217; dreams, and this was Mr.
Moriarity&#8217;s dream: He wanted to be a great musician
and play music that would make all the world
glad. He had always loved music; in the olden
days in Kerry County, when he was no larger
than John, he used to creep out of his bed at
night, tiptoe into the barn, and hide in the straw
to listen to Tim, his big brother, sing about a girl
called Kathleen Mavourneen, and Peggy Machree,
and The Low Back Car to the cows and pigs.
The cows would moo and the pigs would squeal
their applause, and then Mr. Moriarity, who was
called Andy in those days, would tiptoe back
to his blankets and hide his head and sing Peggy
Machree in a tiny voice. It was not at all good
music, but it made him feel good. So he dreamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
about the day that he should be a great musician
and all the people would clap and the pigs squeal
and the cows moo when he played. He wanted
to play the violin because it sounds like the wind
singing in the heather, but violins cost a great
deal of money and lessons cost more, and Andy&#8217;s
father was only a poor vegetable grower near
the bogs. So it looked as though Andy would
never be rich enough to have his dream. His fairy
became unhappy and pale, because music fairies
are the frailest, most delicate little things, and
lovely melodies are sunshine for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day Andy was out in the heart of the
moor listening to the wind in the purple heather
and singing a song that he had made all himself.
His fairy was sitting on a wild rosebush listening
to the music. I know I have a perfectly
awful voice, but this is the song he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;The wild rose is my fairy love, my lady love, my pretty love.</div>
<div class="verse">The wild rose is my fairy love and I don&#8217;t care who knows it.</div>
<div class="verse">She dances for the moorland green, the Irish green, the hillside green,</div>
<div class="verse">And smiles and smiles and smiles upon the breeze that blows it.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Now, what do you think happened as he sang?
Across the moor came a large, fat man with a
violin case under his arm, and a smile upon his
face. He hid in the heather until Andy had
stopped singing, then came out and sat down in
front of him, and the big man and the small boy
talked about music. Then the big man took out
his brown old violin and put it to his chin and
began to play. Andy leaned back and closed his
eyes and discovered the strangest thing! He could
see just as well with his eyes closed as with them
open. And this is what he saw! First the heather
commenced to quiver as though the breeze were
blowing from all four sides; then the twigs parted
and out came his own fairy, all dressed in brown
and gold. She danced a skipping dance on the
twigs, then stamped her tiny foot rather impatiently
and clapped her hands. The twigs parted
again and out came another fairy, a boy fairy,
dressed in grey and gold, and he took her hand
and they danced together. Then the boy fairy
sang the very same song that Andy had sung,
and down from the East Wind came a whole
world of little fairies, all gold and silver, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
spiderweb wings and dresses of every color. They
danced here and there and everywhere, the wildest,
loveliest dance there ever was. Up and down
and backwards and forwards, in circles and fairy
rings they swung and then the heather began to
sway and the wild rosebush to bend and the green
grass to wave and all the fields danced to the fairy
measure. Andy jumped up, threw his brown cap
into the air, and crowed like a rooster. He folded
his arms then and danced with them, a dance that
was a jig and a hornpipe and a reel and a minuet
all in one. The big man laughed as though he
were ashamed and put away his violin and would
play no more. But Andy told him how much he
loved music, and what do you think? The wonderful
man was so pleased that he told Andy to
come to him every night and he should learn
to play on the violin that was two hundred years
old. Andy was so excited that he forgot to feed
the pigs that night and hardly ate any bread
himself. Off he skipped after dinner to the
house across the moor for his first lesson. But
when he played it did not sound at all nice. The
big man said time would change things, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
time that spoiled things, after all. Andy learned
the C scale and the F sharp scale pretty well. But
scales were not the kind of music he had dreamed
of and he became tired of practicing. That ended
things. He never practiced nor even learned the
octave stretch. This was all his own fault, because
his fingers were very lively and long, but
that would not do any good without training.
Finally, one night the big man became discouraged
and said there was no use wasting time with
a boy who would not help himself, so Andy&#8217;s
music lessons ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many years passed and Andy came to California
and became a green grocer. His music
fairy hated money and business so much that she
almost died. One evening in the Spring Andy
came home, cross and tired from selling lettuce,
and would not talk to his wife or five children
at all. He went out into the poppy field and
lay down and went to sleep. And there he
dreamed the very same dream that had come
to him when the big man had played on the moor.
Down on the sea breeze came the gold and silver
and many-colored fairies and they skipped and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
danced and bowed and pirouetted in a perfect
dance of Spring. Up jumped old Moriarity, forgetting
all about his rheumatism, and he danced
with the fairies just as he had done when he was
a boy. Right in the middle of it, when his face
was all red and his eyes burning, out came Mrs.
Moriarity and she held her hands on her hips
and stared. But all of a sudden she caught
Andy&#8217;s eye and he laughed, so up she pulled her
skirts to her knees and commenced to dance with
him, singing at the top of her voice all about
Paddy Dear. She made such a noise that out
came the five Moriarity children and they could
hardly believe their eyes, for they had never seen
their mother and father act that way before. But
there was no need of worrying; out into the
poppy field they skipped and there, by the light
of Lady Rumdidoodledum and a million other
stars, danced Mr. Moriarity and Mrs. Moriarity
and the five little Moriaritys, with oodles and
oodles of fairies. All of a sudden Mrs. Moriarity
felt a stitch in her side and she stopped and took
Mr. Moriarity by the ear and led him into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
house. Moriarity&#8217;s fairy was so happy that she
laughed and wept all night.</p>

<p>&#8220;So now, whenever things go a little bit wrong,
Moriarity throws aside his vegetable bag, calls his
wife and children, and out to the fields they go
to dance in the evening light. Moriarity sings
Kathleen Mavourneen and Peggy Machree and
The Low Back Car, and out come all the fairies
and dance, too. Of course, Mr. Moriarity&#8217;s voice
is still pretty bad, so the cows all moo and the
pigs all squeal, but the poppies smile and the
wild rose bows and the fairies are happy as happy
can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>IN WHICH MARTHA MARY INVADES THE CASTLE,<br />
AND FATHER PROVES THAT HE CAN DO OTHER<br />
THINGS BESIDES WRITING BUSINESS IN BIG BOOKS.<br />
ALSO SOMEONE ARRIVES</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span> was very busy in his den, with the
blinds all drawn and the small log fire lit and a
huge stack of papers on his desk. So Martha
Mary was rather afraid when she tapped at his
door; you see, the Den was Father&#8217;s private property,
just like a castle, and no outsiders, not
even the children, went in very often.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; called Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, it is me,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is &#8216;me&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martha Mary, and may I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Father shoved the big pile of papers aside
and opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sister,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what is the trouble?
Has Liza fallen in the lake?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;Father! No! Liza never does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Mary put her arm about Father&#8217;s waist
just as she always did when she wanted to ask
him a favor. Father always would grant the
favor then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you think you could
do something for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depends what, Sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mother Dear has gone to town and
Flip has driven her to the train and we have
played everything and don&#8217;t know what to do. So
we thought, as long as Flip wasn&#8217;t here, you might
be able to tell us a story. Do you think you
could?&#8221;</p>

<p>Father laughed. &#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid my stories would not interest you. You
see, I don&#8217;t know anything about fairies. But I
might try, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he had finished what he supposed,
Martha Mary had danced down the hall and
back she came with the whole Sherman family,
including Hermit. It only needed Mother Dear
and Flip to make the invasion of the den complete.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Hermit was the oldest, so he chose the
rug before the fire and Liza lay down by his side.
Walter and Edward Lee each sat on an arm of
Father&#8217;s Morris chair, Martha Mary sat on the
floor with her head on Father&#8217;s knee, and John
lay on his stomach before the fire and pulled
Hermit&#8217;s tail.</p>

<p>Father took some time to commence, so Martha
Mary, who knew it would be hard work for him,
tried to help him along.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to tell about Fairies,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Kings and queens will do, or even every-day
people. And Flip never begins with &#8216;once
upon a time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; asked Father. &#8220;Well, I am
going to be different. My story is going to commence
with &#8216;once upon a time&#8217; and it isn&#8217;t going
to be about Kings or Queens or Fairies, or not
even every-day people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said John. &#8220;It&#8217;s about pirates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ice cream,&#8221; said Liza.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, Butterfly. Not even ice cream.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;I give up,&#8221; said Edward Lee, although he
hadn&#8217;t been guessing at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would never guess,&#8221; said Father. &#8220;So
be quiet and I&#8217;ll tell you. It happened ever and
ever and ever so long ago&mdash;I mean once upon a
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long time ago. Now, if you are going
to interrupt, I will not go on. It happened once
upon a time, in the year eighteen hundred and
sixty-four. There was a small boy&mdash;oh, about
nine years old&mdash;and his name was Leonard. Of
course people did not call him that; everybody
has to have some short name. It would never
do to call him Lenny, because that sounded girlish,
like Jennie, so they called him Mick; you see,
he had red hair and freckles just like a little
Irishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he?&#8221; interrupted Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not! He was an American. And
he lived on a large farm and didn&#8217;t have much
to do all day but build forts and shoot peas in
a willow gun and fight heaps and heaps of make-believe
enemies. His Father was a soldier, gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
away to fight the Southerners, and the only reason
he wasn&#8217;t perfectly happy was because he was
not old enough to go to war himself. So he used
to make-believe and he beat the Southerners almost
every day. One morning he was in the
chicken yard, fighting the hens with a wooden
sword, and all at once he heard&mdash;&mdash; Guess
what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Mother calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he heard real music, with fifes and drums
and horns playing the most wonderful tune he
had ever heard. He jumped up and rushed across
the field as quickly as his short legs would carry
him, stumbling all the time, because it was the kind
of music a person tries to keep in step with.
Down to the fence at the edge of the farm he
went and way off down the road he saw a cloud
of dust, coming nearer all the time, while the
music grew louder and louder. It was so exciting
that he became all hot and red and he cut his
legs all up climbing on to the stone fence. There
he sat until the cloud of dust came right across
the field and he saw it was thousands and thousands
of soldiers. But they weren&#8217;t like what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
thought they would be; not at all like the way his
Father looked when he marched away to war.
They had no brass buttons or gold braid and their
swords didn&#8217;t shine at all. They were all dirty
and tired and hungry, but they walked just as
lively as though they were on a picnic, and they
danced&mdash;some of them&mdash;and cheered and sang the
song that goes &#8216;while we were marching through
Georgia.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would keep still,&#8221; said John.
&#8220;This is a wonderful story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary should know it,&#8221; said Father. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a fine song. And so they tramped along, singing
as loud as they could, and if you had heard
them you wouldn&#8217;t have been able to keep still,
either. Well, Mick was very much excited. He
jumped up and down on the stone wall, waving
his hat and almost crying, he was so happy. Then,
what do you think? He jumped so much that
he tumbled off the wall and right into the road.
It hurt awfully, too, but he couldn&#8217;t cry, because
all the soldiers would see him and he was
a soldier&#8217;s son. He just lay still and bit his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
lower lip. Then the most wonderful thing happened.
A big man rode along and saw Mick, and
he swung his sword above his head so it shone in
the sun, even if it was all rusty.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Halt!&#8217; he shouted, and all the soldiers stood
still.</p>

<p>&#8220;The big man jumped off his horse and picked
up Mick and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter, Son?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mick just scowled and said, &#8216;Nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Does it hurt much?&#8217; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said Mick. He was determined not to
cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;The big man winked to one of the soldiers
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know what will fix it. Swing him up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The soldier saluted and said, &#8216;On your horse,
General?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Certainly,&#8217; said the General. So the soldier
picked Mick up and put him on the neck of the
big brown horse and the General swung up behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now,&#8217; he said, &#8216;give your orders!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What shall I say?&#8217; asked Mick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;&#8216;You are the commander,&#8217; said the General.
&#8216;What are your orders?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first Mick couldn&#8217;t believe his ears. Of
course it sounded too good to be true, so you could
hardly blame him. But he wasn&#8217;t going to lose
the chance, so he swung around and faced the
thousands of soldiers and shouted just as loud as
he possibly could:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Forward, march!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he remembered something Tom, the
farmhand, had once shouted, so he shouted it:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Down with the rebels! We&#8217;ll eat them alive!
Forward!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have heard the soldiers shout.
They cheered and shouted and called, &#8216;Eat &#8217;em
alive!&#8217; and down the road went the whole army,
with Mick leading them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not mind the way he bounced on the
horse; he didn&#8217;t mind anything, excepting that
he was a real soldier and commanding the most
wonderful army. On and on the army marched,
singing &#8216;Bring the good old bugle, boys,&#8217; and Mick
sang with them. He didn&#8217;t know the words so he
just shouted, but that didn&#8217;t make any difference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
because everyone was making such a noise that no
one could hear what he was singing. Tramp,
tramp, they marched and you could hear the
bugles and almost hear the cannon if you closed
your eyes and made-believe. And so they came
to the end of the stone wall and the General
whispered to Mick:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Command them to stop!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mick shouted, &#8216;Halt!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the General jumped down from his
horse and lifted Mick off and gave him a whole
pocket of empty cartridges. He saluted him
just as though he were a grown-up soldier and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you any further orders, Sir, before we
leave you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mick thought a moment, then said: &#8216;Yes. Go
ahead and beat all the rebels and eat &#8217;em alive.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again the General saluted him, and he saluted
the General, and the General said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is your name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mick Leonard Sherman. What is yours?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s queer,&#8217; said the General. &#8216;Mine is
Sherman, too. Now we are going to march ahead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
all the way to the sea, and we&#8217;ll beat all the
rebels.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he sprang to his horse and shouted,
&#8216;Forward!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down the road and around the turn went the
whole army, while Mick sat on the fence and
watched till the very last soldier was out of
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the last Mick ever saw of them. But
the soldiers, all cheered by their song and by
the brightness of their flag of red and white and
blue, marched on. Days and days they tramped,
building bridges across the rivers they came to,
helping one another when they grew very tired,
capturing spies that they met, and winning all
battles. Oh, but they were wonderful fighters!
For miles and miles away you could hear their
cannons roaring and every shot of their guns
brought them nearer to victory and peace. For
you know after all, Chicks, they had to fight, as
every true American would fight, to help his country,
but they longed for peace. They didn&#8217;t
at all enjoy killing their enemies. But right was
on their side and so they fought, on and on, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
always their flag went on before them, and all
enemies were swept away. Of course they had
to win, because the last command Mick Leonard
Sherman had given them was to beat all the
rebels and eat them alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>was</i> a story,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I knew all the time,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knew what, Sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was General Sherman marching from Atlanta
to the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I knew,&#8221; said Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you know, Son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mick was Uncle Leonard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again right. And that is not all. Guess
where Mother Dear has gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give up!&#8221; they all shouted together.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone to the City to meet Uncle
Leonard and bring him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as he said it the do-si-do cart rolled into
the garden and out rushed all the children to
greet the wonderful uncle who had commanded
General Sherman&#8217;s army years and years ago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
He laughed and got red, because he didn&#8217;t know
why they were all so very glad to see him. They
almost forgot Mother Dear, all excepting Liza,
and she was too young, anyway, to care very
much about soldiers and Generals and fighting for
the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>IN WHICH FLIP TELLS MY FAVORITE STORY, AND<br />
IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT VERY MUCH, FLIP<br />
KNOWS SOMEONE WHO WILL</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Smudge</span> was asleep; very peacefully asleep
for so huge a personage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a personage?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very important person. Now, don&#8217;t interrupt!
Smudge was asleep at the sunset end
of the valley. There was a bald spot on his head,
all grey and cold, and grey spots climbing up
him, and dark grey-blue corners that the firs
shaded. You see, Smudge was the biggest mountain
you can possibly imagine. About the feet
of him grew oaks that were grey and they hid
a very world of little folk. Smudge had sat at
the sunset end of the valley for several years;
ten thousand years, the owl says, and he knows.
So, of course, there were many flower folks hiding
about, for in all of the ten thousand years there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
had been many children born in the world beyond
the valley and you, Butterfly, and everyone
else knows that every time a child creature
is born in the world beyond the valley there is
another flower creature, sometimes a gloriously
bold California poppy, more often a rather silly
little violet, born in the flower world. As I told
you, Smudge, all grey and cold, was sleeping at
the sunset end of the valley. As he slept, a bird,
somewhere in the trees, piped a morning song.
Smudge shivered and a cool, shivery breeze came
through the groves. Again the tree creature piped
and then the stupid bald spot of grey on Smudge&#8217;s
nice old head took on a strange flush. As he
flushed the sky in the other end of the valley
grew the color of a baby rose; the grass in the
valley stirred, and a rabbit-person with an adorable
bunch of white cotton for a tail sat up and
cocked two pink ears. And Smudge, sleepy, ten-thousand-year-old
Smudge, yawned, and his stirring
sent a family of meadow larks dancing into
the grey sky. They sang a song, all golden and
gay, and the grey-pink sky grew golden, and the
fir tops blushed and ripples of crimson laughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
skipped on the silver-grey stream in the valley.
The Poppy folk bestirred themselves and stretched
wide their arms; the boldest of the violets peered
above the frail maidenhair and a Brown-Eyed-Susan
sat up to greet Smudge. And lazy Smudge
slept on. But the morning would not have it so;
down from the bald spot and over the lazy creature&#8217;s
body crept the dawn-flush, painting bits of
red below his eyes and golden tan in the many-year-old
wrinkles; the beard of cypress trees shook
out their branches and the stream that danced
about Smudge&#8217;s mouth became boisterously happy.
And <span class="allsmcap">STILL</span> Smudge slept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of the pussy willows, with a flutter of
wings, came a butterfly-person, so very yellow
that the glow that was the sun hid in dismay for
a moment&mdash;only a moment&mdash;behind a copper
cloud. Up to the heights darted the butterfly, a
spot of gold against the huge mountain of grey-pink.
It soared and danced an undignified minuet,
then floated down and tickled Smudge on the
lips, and Smudge smiled in his sleep. The golden
butterfly snapped its eyes, for it was very much
provoked; up into the sky of blue it went again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
and flitted its wings, then came down and again
tickled the old creature, this time, most wisely,
on the nostril, and, just as you might expect,
Smudge sneezed and woke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was very wonderful&mdash;it came like a
wondrous burst of love music. The sun poured
over the world and all the Flower folk and bird
creatures and every rabbit and field mouse and
worm danced out into the morning sunshine and
sang a lovely morning prayer that I, stupid
creature, have forgotten every word of. Smudge
grunted and wiped the sleep from his eyes and
grinned and saw the golden yellowbird butterfly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good morning, Loveliness,&#8217; said Smudge.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good morning, Old One,&#8217; said the disrespectful
yellow bird. Then she danced on
Smudge&#8217;s lip and tickled his ear. When he bent
branches to capture her she darted away and
came back to laugh and impudently put her fingers
to her nose. Sentimental old Smudge sighed and
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Loveliness! I wish you were more serious
so that I could love you the more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indignantly, Loveliness flew away, down into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the valley and flirted with a baby daisy. Smudge
laughed indulgently, in the manner of the aged,
and called to him his counselor. Can you guess
who his counselor was, Butterfly? It was a man-baby,
a tiny pink one, with just a bit of sunny
hair on his head and funny, fat little wrinkles
on his baby body. He was the counselor because
he was Youth, and only Youth and Smudge could
live forever. Smudge became dignified and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Wise One, what is the business of the
day?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The baby-being laughed and caught a grasshopper
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Blackbird.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Blackbird?&#8217; stormed Smudge. &#8216;What
have I to do with her? Day and day again I
have said that she is nothing to me; poor, somber
bit of ebony. I want sunshine and the crystal&#8217;s
colors and dancing and happiness; not blackness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man-baby laughed and stuck a blade of
grass in the grasshopper&#8217;s ear and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Silly, silly! If the Blackbird loves you so
much, then you must have to do with her, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
her love makes her more precious than all your
other subjects.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smudge sneered and made a nasty remark
about the words of infants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Children, what do you think happened?
A whole thousand years and a half passed and
there came another sunrise. Smudge sat up and
yawned and became frightened, for there was no
golden flush in the sky and no poppy color in
the fields. He shivered and called the man-baby,
and the man-baby came riding on the back of a
jack-rabbit, pulling its tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good morning, Lord Smudge,&#8217; said the man-baby.
&#8216;You look as though you needed medicine.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t be impudent!&#8217; shouted Smudge.
&#8216;Where is the sun and the golden Butterfly bird?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please,&#8217; said the man-baby. &#8216;The sun has
rheumatism and the golden bird has gone away
with an eagle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So!&#8217; screamed Smudge, just like a peevish
giant. &#8216;What am I to do all day alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please,&#8217; said the man-baby. &#8216;There is the
Blackbird.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;Smudge yawned. &#8216;All right,&#8217; he grumbled.
&#8216;Call the Blackbird!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man-baby stood up on the jack-rabbit&#8217;s
back and galloped down into the valley, into a
cradle of violets and cream-cups. There he found
the Blackbird and said to her, &#8216;Come!&#8217; The
Blackbird hopped to the jack-rabbit&#8217;s tail, and the
three galloped back to Smudge.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good morning,&#8217; grumbled Smudge, ungraciously.
&#8216;So you&#8217;ve come at last to give me a
day of blackness and creeps?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man-baby giggled so that he tumbled
right off the jack-rabbit and spilled into a wild
rosebush. There he lay and you could hear him
snickering.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; shouted Smudge. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you
speak?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Blackbird hid her head and whispered,
&#8216;I love you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Silly child,&#8217; said Smudge. &#8216;Come out and
let me see you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sat up so he could see better and then,
Children, he almost fell right out of his valley
bed. For the Blackbird was sitting on a branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
of a willow tree, and right on each of her black
wings was a large ruby of lovely crimson,
brighter&mdash;oh, very much brighter than the brightest
flower you have ever seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Loveliness,&#8217; shouted Smudge, using the same
name he had used for the golden butterfly bird
(men always do), &#8216;I thought you were black and
somber.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was,&#8217; said the Blackbird, and her eyes became
all teary.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But the sunlight on your wings and the valley
of green of your eyes and the rainbow of your
neck! Where did they come from, Loveliness?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I love you,&#8217; said the Blackbird-with-the-crimson-wings.
&#8216;I have loved you for more than a
thousand years, more years than there are buttercups
on the hill. And so, with thinking of you
and longing to have you love me, how could I
help but grow the way you wished?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Loveliness, Loveliness,&#8217; Smudge whispered,
in a very gruff, choky whisper. The man-baby
fell from a willow tree and bumped his nose on
Smudge&#8217;s toe and sat up and laughed. Then all
the valley grew golden and the sky was glory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
bright; the meadow larks sang as they sat on the
twigs, and the violets and wild pansies and buttercups
and golden cups and poppies and brown-eyed-susans
and forget-me-nots and daisies
danced a lovely, happy dance that frightened
away the very grey old owl, and another day
was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>IN WHICH EDWARD LEE AND WALTER GO ON THE<br />
WARPATH BECAUSE THEY DON&#8217;T KNOW WHAT<br />
ELSE TO DO, AND ON ACCOUNT OF THEM JOHN<br />
AND MARTHA MARY MISS HEARING THE MELODRAMA</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward Lee</span> and Walter were on the warpath.
The warpath leads through the orchard to the
power-house where the big engine pumps water
that irrigates all the farmland, even to Levy&#8217;s
place. The cause of the two warriors&#8217; fighting
mood was this; they were bored with Life; bored
with lessons, and bored through and through with
the stories of fairies and other silliness that Flip
always told. So, they went on the warpath, armed
with all the clothes-line they could find in the
laundry, and two wooden swords. The first victim,
luckily for them, was John. He was seated
on a wheelbarrow outside of the power-house, trying
to smoke dried magnolia leaves. This made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
him feel cold and wobbly and not at all in fighting
trim. So it was a simple matter for Edward
Lee and Walter to jump on him from the rear,
tie him in approved warrior fashion, gag him
with a handkerchief, and lead him into the
power-house. There they held a council of war;
John was convicted of innumerable offences, including
kissing Uncle Mick, and condemned to
spend the afternoon in confinement, tied to the
power engine. He struggled manfully when
they tied him to his post, but it was no use;
the magnolia leaf smoke had made him too sick
to fight, and in short order he was a helpless,
speechless prisoner. Then the warriors planned
the strategic stroke that would trap Martha Mary.
Up the warpath the two men marched boldly and
to the door of Martha Mary&#8217;s sun-room. She was
seated on a small trunk, painting red violets all
over a cake-plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;we have been sent by
the King to bring you into his presence. You
are to come at once, but you must be gagged and
blindfolded because you mustn&#8217;t see the way to
the Royal Palace. Are you ready?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Of course Martha Mary knew that John
was the king, and she was flattered that he had
sent for her. So she allowed herself to be bound
and gagged and blindfolded and led down the warpath.
She knew all the time where she was going,
because the power-house always was the
Palace. But she didn&#8217;t know what was going to
happen, so you can imagine her surprise when she
found herself tied to the wall and then tried and
convicted of crying at Flip&#8217;s last story and condemned
to spend the afternoon, just like John,
in solitary confinement. She didn&#8217;t know John
was there already, and he could not tell her because
he was gagged. So the warriors tied her to
the wall next to John and then locked the power-house
door and went off to find Flip. He was
busy making a new bridle for Peggy, the Shetland
pony, and as he did not work with his mouth
the warriors knew that he would have no excuse
for not telling a story. They jumped on his
back when he didn&#8217;t expect it and refused to get
off until he had agreed to tell them a tale that had
no women or fairies in it at all. Flip agreed but
first he rolled Walter and Edward Lee off his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
back and on to the floor to prove to them that he
wasn&#8217;t beaten.</p>

<p>This is the story he told them, and although
there is one woman in it, if the girl listeners do
not like it they don&#8217;t have to listen because it is
not intended for them anyhow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Doughnuts and Crullers,&#8217; swore the pirate
chief as he wiped a quantity of blood off his
throat-ripper on to his red sleeve. &#8216;Doughnuts
and Crullers! I have an idea!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yoho, yoho,&#8217; shouted all the pirate band
gathered about. &#8216;The Chief has an idea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A marvel-l-lous idea,&#8217; quoth the Chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Marvelous,&#8217; shouted the band.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Doughnuts and Crullers,&#8217; shrieked the Chief,
although he knew lots of other cusses, too.
&#8216;You&#8217;ve made such a noise that I have forgotten
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the Chief frowned and his temper became
terrible because he seldom had ideas and
he hated to lose them when they did come. He
became so furious that he shouted:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Bring out Red Blood Ike, the one-eyed
Swede!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately a dozen valiant pirates sprang
into the black tent and came out with the one-eyed
Swede. He was a terrible looking person.
One eye was gone, altogether, and the other one
was pink. But that wasn&#8217;t all. He had only
one arm&mdash;the right one&mdash;and only one leg&mdash;the
left one. His mouth was black as coal. That
came from his habit of eating fire; he really
could, just like drinking water or anything else.
And he liked it. He said it tasted like fried
spinach.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Orange Marmalade,&#8217; he shouted, for that was
HIS favorite cuss. &#8216;What do you want with
me? I was dreaming of cutting off the fingers
of all Republicans and you have disturbed
me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ike,&#8217; said the Chief, &#8216;I had an idea and I
lost it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, yes,&#8217; said Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That is all,&#8217; said the Chief. &#8216;Only now I
feel so badly that unless you can give me a plan
my whole day will be spoiled. And I wanted it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to be a nice day. I have not killed anyone for a
long time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Red Blood Ike bit his mustache, which was a
habit he had when he was thinking. It kept him
cool and steady-nerved which is the way all true
pirates must be.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Perhaps,&#8217; he said, &#8216;if someone sings to me
a sad, sweet song, I will be able to help you. You
know, Chief, I can always think best when someone
sings sad, sweet songs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is a good suggestion,&#8217; said the Chief,
&#8216;nothing is as soothing to the mind as sad, sweet
songs, unless it be killing people or fighting Indians.
Call out our singer, you lazy dogs!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They called out Hairslip Charles, the baritone
of the gang. He sat on a whisky barrel
and sharpened his throat-ripper and sang Ike&#8217;s
favorite song: the one about the Pigs and little
Fishes:</p>

<p>&#8220;The tears poured down Ike&#8217;s cheeks as Hairslip
Charles sang, and when the song was through
Ike raised his hand and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the pirates sprang to their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He has it,&#8217; they shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Proceed,&#8217; commanded the Chief. I forgot to
tell you that his name was Mr. Smith, but they
usually called him Blue Murder Smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is my plan,&#8217; said Ike. &#8216;We will send
our bold men out to capture three prisoners.
We will tie them to a stake and then, with threats
of endless terrors, make each of them give us an
idea. The one who has the best idea will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
granted anything he wishes and then set free;
the other two must&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Die,&#8217; roared the band.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Die,&#8217; said Ike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blue Murder Smith was delighted with
the idea. He sent his men out to find three
prisoners and they rode miles across the mountains
until they came to the stage road. Down
the road came a coach drawn by six huge horses.
Ike, who was leading the assaulting party, hid
in the bushes with his men until the coach came
by; then they sprang out and Ike put his ten-inch
gun to the driver&#8217;s head while the gang held
the horses. Then Shivering Sam threw open the
door of the coach and commanded the people in
it to come out. There were exactly three. The
first was a traveling man who sold underwear
when business was good. He got out, moaning
and praying for them not to take his samples.
The next was a handsome officer with gold
braid on his uniform and a bold look in his
eye. And the third was the loveliest, most
golden-haired girl you have ever seen. The pirates
tied them together and drove them back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
camp, leaving the coach-driver bound to a tree.
For all I know he may still be there. They came
into camp and Blue Murder Smith arose, twisted
his mustache and greeted his prisoners. His
orders were that they be fastened to stakes and
then given a chance to tell the three ideas. The
traveling salesman was the only one who struggled;
he had an appointment with a customer
at seven o&#8217;clock and he knew his firm would be
furious if he didn&#8217;t keep it. So they gave him
the first chance to tell an idea. After much
thought, this is what he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am supposed to be in the next town to-night
to sell a carload of underwear&mdash;W. &amp; W.
quality, selling at fifty per cent. off, I recommend
that you gentlemen use it. If I don&#8217;t get
there my firm will be in danger of losing a good
customer and I of losing my position. So you
let me go ahead and I&#8217;ll sell my bill and get the
money for it; then I&#8217;ll take the stage back to-morrow,
you can hold us up again and take the
money away from me and then let me go. As
long as I don&#8217;t lose the customer the firm won&#8217;t
be so angry that the money was stolen.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Bah!&#8217; sneered Shivering Sam. &#8216;That is a
poor idea. We&#8217;ll send to your customer and take
the money away from him and keep you, too, and
probably roast you. And we&#8217;ll make new flags
for our fleet out of the underwear if it is red.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right-O!&#8217; said Mr. Blue Murder Smith.
&#8216;Now let&#8217;s hear the soldier&#8217;s idea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They tied the salesman up again and dragged
the soldier out and got his lovely uniform all
mussed. As they pulled him he clutched the
fingers of the golden-haired girl and kissed them,
and she looked so sad that tears came into the
single pink eye of Red Blood Ike. But he was a
pirate&#8217;s son and had to be hard of heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;The soldier looked very frightened. He
bowed politely to the pirate band and told his
idea and it was even worse than the salesman&#8217;s
plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted the pirates to let him go if he
would sing them a song. Now, you know they
were musical pirates and liked music, so they were
inclined to accept his offer. But when he began
to sing in a heart-breaking tone, &#8216;Darling,
I am growing old, Silver threads amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
gold,&#8217; they all began to hoot and shriek to drown
his simply awful voice. Then they led him away
without further words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Blue Murder Smith smacked his lips
and shouted, &#8216;Doughnuts and Crullers! Have
out the woman!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t seem to be at all frightened. She
shook hands with Hairslip Charles and asked Mr.
Smith how all the little Smiths were, although
there were none at all because Mr. Smith never
had time to be married. Then she told her
plan, and you can be sure it was exciting. This
was it:</p>

<p>&#8220;She said that way down in the Southern Seas
there was an island inhabited by a tribe of one-legged
negroes. They lived on cocoanuts and
whisky; they were very gentle and had no cannibalistic
habits (which means that they were not
cannibals). A long time ago, nearly ten years,
a ship had been wrecked off the island with a
cargo of Spanish gold and fruit cake. Also
a brand new crown that had been made in Paris
for the Island King. When the ship was on the
rocks two sailors had swum ashore with the chests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of gold and the crown. Then the weight of the
fruit cake sunk the leaking ship. The two sailors
had dragged the treasure way up on the island
and buried it. But it would be quite easy to find.
You landed and walked right to the very center
of the island, then wet your finger and held it
up in the air. The side of the finger that was
coldest was the direction you had to dig and you
were sure to find the treasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Orange Marmalade,&#8217; cussed Ike. &#8216;This
sounds good. But how do we know you are
speaking the truth?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here,&#8217; said the golden-haired girl, &#8216;is a piece
of the gold. You see my father was one of the
sailors who was saved.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She held out her hand and sure enough there
was a piece of the gold, all yellow and shiny.
Smith bit it and said it was all right. Then the
pirate chief took a vote and found that the girl&#8217;s
idea had been the only good one, and that, as they
had agreed, she should be given anything she
wished and allowed to go free.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please,&#8217; said the girl, &#8216;may I have anything
I really and truly wish?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Absolutely anything,&#8217; said Smith, and then
he got frightened for the golden-haired girl
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, you lovely, lovely pirate,&#8217; and tried to
kiss him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; shouted Smith. &#8216;What do you
want?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If I can have anything,&#8217; said the girl, and
looked with soft eyes at the soldier, &#8216;I want you
to hold these two prisoners for just two days
so that I can have prayers said for them before
they die.&#8217; Her eyes twinkled; she looked at the
salesman and said to Smith:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And please, when you roast this man, put
in plenty of salt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We will,&#8217; said Smith, and &#8216;We will,&#8217; shouted
his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they brought a horse and lifted the
girl on to the saddle. As she leaned over to kiss
the soldier good-by, she whispered something in
his ear that no one else could hear, but Smith
didn&#8217;t bother because he thought it was just a
good-by. It wasn&#8217;t, though, as you soon shall
hear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Down the road the girl went at a gallop, as
fast as her horse could carry her. All afternoon
she rode and just before sunset came into the soldier&#8217;s
camp. Up to the General&#8217;s tent she cantered
and then stood before him, all breathless.
She told him everything that had happened and
begged him to take his men and save the soldier,
and the salesman, too, if he wished, although she
didn&#8217;t mind so much about him. The General
scratched his white beard and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why should I do this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Sir,&#8217; she said, &#8216;the soldier is your son.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Murder and Death,&#8217; roared the General.
&#8216;I&#8217;ll have their heads; the villains!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ordered out a whole company of cavalry,
and jumped on his own horse and down the
road they went, led by the golden-haired girl.
They rode all night as fast as the wind, and came
in sight of the land pirates&#8217; camp just before
sunrise.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We must go slowly,&#8217; said the General. In a
loud whisper he ordered his men off their horses
and then, with guns in hand, they crept into the
camp on their hands and knees. The first thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
they heard was the soldier prisoner snoring. He
was making such a noise that the golden-haired
girl thought he would wake the pirates, so she
crept up and put her fingers over his lips. He
dreamed someone was trying to poison him and
bit, just as hard as he could. Of course the girl
screamed, and out came the whole company of
pirates. Then, how they fought! You never
heard such a racket in your life; there was screaming
and shouting and firing of guns and blood all
about, and over all you could hear Blue Murder
Smith cussing:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Crullers and Doughnuts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Ike shrieking, &#8216;Orange Marmalade.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They fought for hours and hours. That is,
all but the salesman. As soon as the General
cut his ropes, he grabbed his samples and ran
like the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The others fought on, and the first thing you
knew, every last pirate was stretched cold and
dead on the hard, hard ground. And then the
soldier held out his arms and the golden-haired
girl came into them and the cavalry all cheered
and the General blessed them (I mean the girl and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her soldier) and&mdash;they, no doubt, lived happily
ever after.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; said Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orange Marmalade,&#8221; shouted Edward Lee.
&#8220;Here come the pirates.&#8221; Down the road he
charged straight into the arms of Mother Dear,
almost knocking her over.</p>

<p>All afternoon Edward Lee and Walter were
soldiers and pirates and they attacked everybody
on the place before dinner. Even then they
did not want to go in, but Father insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by the way,&#8221; said Father. &#8220;Where are
Martha Mary and John?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward Lee looked at Walter and Walter
looked at Edward Lee and then they remembered.
Down to the power-house they rushed and there
were the prisoners, all pale and tired and wobbly
in the legs. Edward Lee really felt badly. He
kissed Martha Mary and begged her not to care.
He offered to shake hands with John, but John
wouldn&#8217;t shake. As for Walter, he got a laughing
fit and wouldn&#8217;t stop until Father ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
him off to bed without any dinner. Later Martha
Mary sneaked up the back stairs with a tray for
him and no one knew it. Then Mother Dear felt
worried and said it wasn&#8217;t wise to let him go to
sleep without eating, so she took him another tray
and found Martha Mary&#8217;s. And still later, when
he thought no one would notice, Father tiptoed
up the back stairs with still more, and Walter
had a gorgeous time. And Father laughed and
spanked him and then hugged him.</p>

<p>IN WHICH LIZA GOES UNDER THE SIDEBOARD; WALTER<br />
AND EDWARD LEE FIX THE CAT, AND FLIP<br />
PROVES THAT THE CITY FOGS ARE NICE</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Liza who discovered the secret. She was
hiding from Hermit, and the best place to hide is
under the sideboard, because Hermit is too large
to crawl there. She was very quiet; so quiet that
no one knew she was there at all. When Mother
Dear and Father came in to put flowers on the
table, she lay still as still could be and heard everything
they said. Then she went right off to tell
John although it was supposed to be a secret.
John was busy taking an alarm clock apart, but
he stopped when Liza came, and kissed her nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Big Sister,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Which way is
the wind blowing?&#8221; John always asked Liza
interesting things. He didn&#8217;t act at all grown-upish
with her like he did with the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; said Liza, &#8220;what do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;Lots of things,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret,&#8221; said Liza.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>Then Liza told him. The whole family was going
to the City on Saturday and Uncle Captain
Mick was going to take Martha Mary and John to
the theater. The others were to go to the Cliff
House and have lunch on the beach with waffles
and peanuts.</p>

<p>John pretended not to be very much excited.
Even with Liza he was annoying and superior
when anyone was so happy that they could hardly
keep still. But the others acted differently when
they heard. Edward Lee and Walter had to do
something big. So Walter put the white and black
cat in a bucket of whitewash and Edward Lee
put ink on the whitewash to make the black spots
again. They always did queer things when they
were glad. As for Martha Mary&mdash;she sought out
Flip to tell him the news and there the rest of the
younger part of the family, which was of course
the most important part, found her, an hour
later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cities aren&#8217;t so much,&#8221; said John.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Flip thought they were. He had lived in San
Francisco years and years ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t do interesting things there, like
rowing and such,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly can,&#8221; argued Flip.</p>

<p>&#8220;And anyway,&#8221; said John, &#8220;it&#8217;s always foggy
and cold, and things aren&#8217;t alive there like the
trees and hills and things in your stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; said Flip. &#8220;I remember
perfectly well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a story; isn&#8217;t it, please?&#8221; said Martha
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary, and rubbed her
soft, pink cheek against Flip&#8217;s forehead. So
what could Flip do but tell the story?&mdash;the story
of the Things that are alive in the City.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;You see, John really doesn&#8217;t know anything
about it. There are just as many dreams and
fairies and sprites in the City as there are right
here in our own garden. Only everyone has to
attend to business in the City and can&#8217;t always
remember these things. Why, the fairies that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
dance on Tamalpais are the most gorgeously
happy fairies, I think, in all the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Tamperpies?&#8221; Liza wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tamalpais is the biggest, oldest mountain you
have ever dreamed of anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like Smudge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, only not quite so silly and spoiled as
Smudge. It is a very dignified old mountain
even if it is so lovely, and it sits right at the North
Star corner of the bay and rules all the country
for miles and miles around. But old Tamalpais
is not the same as it used to be. When it was
younger&mdash;oh, about twenty years ago&mdash;it was all
covered with nice, tall trees; some of them so high
that one would think the blue sky was resting on
them. There were red berries, too, and vines and
tremendously big ferns and the green things grew
so thickly that one could hardly walk through
them. There were wild things there, too; bears
and deer and wild cats and heaps of squirrels and
more singing birds than there are hairs on Hermit&#8217;s
tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right across the sunset water was the loveliest
city; a city that rambled over a half-dozen queer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
old hills, up and down, twisting about like a regular
jig-saw puzzle. And oh, it was a proud City,
just as haughty and conceited as it could be. Of
course it had lots to be conceited about, for there
never was such a happy city of people before.
They had wonderfully good times in such a perfectly
nice way, and were so lively and busy that
of course they couldn&#8217;t help being proud.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than any of these things, the City was
proud of its lovely mountain across the bay, and
what do you think? The trees and flowers were
so thick on the mountain sides that it could never
see through them and had no idea that the City
was there at all. The City grieved at this because
she loved the mountain so much and wanted
it to love her. She used to send messengers over
to it on Sundays and holidays; boys and girls by
the dozen, in old tramping clothes, and they
would take their lunch along, and sit in the fields
and pick the poppies and violet-blue Lupin to
bring back and put in vases and jugs in the City
homes. One Sunday,&mdash;the sunniest, brightest
Sunday you ever saw,&mdash;one of the messengers
lay down in the grass under a bay tree and lit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
his pipe and thought. I don&#8217;t know what he was
thinking; it must have been something uninteresting,
for little by little, his eyes closed, and the
first thing you knew, he was sound asleep. The
pipe fell out of his mouth and right into some
dried leaves. Then it was awful; the grass caught
on fire and before the messenger awakened the
flames had eaten way out into the forest. The
messenger awoke and tried to fight the fire alone,
but it was useless. He cried for help and people
came rushing from all sides to do what they could,
but it was no use; on and on the fire spread till all
the trees and bushes on the mountain were burned
away. All night the flames raged and the sky
was red, like a sunset, and smoke poured over the
bay. And in the morning the mountain lay, all
bare and black, and oh, the City mourned to see it.
But you know, when anything unpleasant happens,
something nice happens, too. In this case
all the growth of green being gone from Tamalpais,
he could look about him for miles and the
very first thing he saw was the wonderful City&mdash;and&mdash;it
was a case of love at first sight!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the Mountain and the City loved each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
other for years and years and years. Every
morning, the soldiers in the City would fire a
cannon to welcome the sun and that would awaken
Tamalpais. He would yawn and look across the
water; then he would smile and when he smiled
it was like oceans of sunshine. Then the City
would smile an answer and the day would begin.
The hours were so short until dark, one hardly
noticed them pass. In the evening, millions of
lights would come out in the City like the loveliest
diamond necklace of a fairy queen. Only
fairies wear dewdrops and not diamonds. Tamalpais
would gaze and gaze at the lights and the
City would see the huge, black form standing out
against the night sky, and so&mdash;just like a couple
of children&mdash;they grew so interested watching
each other that they forgot to go to bed at all.
That would never do, you know. First the North
Wind scolded the City; then the Lady Moon gave
the mountain an awful lecture, but it didn&#8217;t do
any good. Tamalpais began to have wrinkles
because he did not sleep, and the City became
rather ill-humored. So the North Wind went to
the Sun and asked him what he thought they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
better do. Of course the Sun had a good idea;
he always does seem to manage things somehow.
He waited until late in the afternoon, then the
very last thing, just before bedtime, he went
west, out into the ocean, and drew the water up
in the sky to make lovely white clouds of it.
Then the North Wind came over so gently. He
took the white clouds through the Golden Gate
and heaped them just like hills and hills of white,
soft pillows, all over the City, and the mountain
too. That night no one could sleep; the Mountain
grieved because it couldn&#8217;t see the City, and the
City was lonely because it couldn&#8217;t see the black
form of Tamalpais. But that was only the first
night. After a while they grew rather used to
it and learned to watch for the ocean of white
clouds. Then they would go to sleep, and it was
always more exciting for them to wake up in the
morning and see each other. Of course sometimes
they would wake up and the clouds would still
be there. Then the Mountain would grumble and
the City would shiver, and down would come the
North Wind to carry the clouds away again&mdash;and
there would be sunshine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Now, every night, when the bugles in the
Presidio sound &#8216;Taps,&#8217; which is the soldiers&#8217; song
when they go to sleep, the North Wind hears the
soft, whispering music and brings in arms full
of white clouds so that Tamalpais and the City by
the Golden Gate can go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Edward Lee laughed when Flip had finished
the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very impolite of you,&#8221; said Martha
Mary. &#8220;I liked Tamalpais and you shouldn&#8217;t
laugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t laughing at that,&#8221; said Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it, then?&#8221; asked Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Liza,&#8221; said Edward Lee. &#8220;Look at her.
Someone has been putting white clouds over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, Liza was sound asleep with her
arms about Hermit&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>Hermit was asleep, too, with his mouth open
and his tongue hanging out, although it is very
bad to sleep with one&#8217;s mouth open.</p>

<p>But, you see, Hermit is only a dog and dogs
can&#8217;t understand everything.</p>

<p>IN WHICH MARTHA MARY HAS A WONDERFUL DAY<br />
AND LEARNS THE LOVELIEST OF SECRETS AND<br />
FLIP&#8217;S ASPIRATIONS ARE EXPLAINED</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Martha Mary&#8217;s birthday; the brightest,
happiest birthday she could remember. But, of
course, the last birthday a person has always seems
the nicest. Everyone had presents for her. From
Father and Uncle Captain Mick there were oodles
of books and ribbons and things for a sewing-basket.
John borrowed fifty cents from Levy, the
butcher, and bought a perfectly good spy-glass.
Martha Mary could use it, he said, to spy out the
rest of the family when she wanted company, or
Liza when she got lost. Personally, I think he
expected some pretty good times with it himself.
Walter and Edward Lee sold forty bottles to
the rags-bottles-sacks-man for fifteen cents, and
with the aid of a nail managed to get eleven cents
more out of their penny-bank. They bought five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
molasses sticks, one for each of the children,
which left just a penny over. Mother&#8217;s presents
were the nicest of all. First there was a white
linen cushion to be embroidered with golden poppies;
then there was a book of the Secret Garden
and a perfectly beautiful edition of Peter Pan.
Best of all! Guess what! There was a corset!
It wasn&#8217;t a really and truly corset because Mother
Dear did not approve of them, not even for
grown-up women, but it had whalebone all up
and down it like the strait-jacket they keep
prisoners in.</p>

<p>Martha Mary went under the trees with all her
presents, and John was particularly nice and not
at all grown-upish. He built a throne on the
stump of the old oak tree and Martha Mary sat
there, surrounded by the trees and flowers and
birds, and John made her a wreath of buttercups
and a daisy chain. Then he tooted a blast on
the cook&#8217;s dinner-horn and called all the court to
do homage to Queen Mary.</p>

<p>Flip was out in the field planting alfalfa.
When he heard the horn he stopped work, although
he was quite sure it was not lunch time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
Still, he wasn&#8217;t going to take any chances because
he certainly did like to eat. Across the
lawn he came and there he saw the queen, surrounded
by all her subjects.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; asked Flip. &#8220;Why the celebration?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary, a little bit choky,
&#8220;you have forgotten, Flip, and I did not want
you to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I forget, Ladykin Dear?&#8221; asked
Flip.</p>

<p>Martha Mary would not tell because she did
not want him to feel badly. Neither would John.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell me, Butterfly,&#8221; Flip coaxed Liza.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her birfday,&#8221; said Liza, &#8220;and there is
going to be cake with candles for tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, at first Flip felt so badly that he couldn&#8217;t
talk at all; then he got an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queen Mary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I did forget and it
was hateful of me. But there was a reason for
my forgetting. You see I have a secret, too, and
I&#8217;ve been thinking and thinking about it and almost
forgot everything else. Will you forgive
me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;Yes, but I
should like to know the secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flip bit his lip. He really wanted to tell but
did not know if he had the right. You see when
people know nice things it is much more fun to
tell them to everybody. So he agreed. He said
the secret was only for Martha Mary, so the boys
and Liza would have to go away for ten minutes.
Martha Mary raised her willow branch scepter
and ordered them away. Then Flip lay on the
grass and rested his head against Martha Mary&#8217;s
knees and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;I am waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to tell, Silly,&#8221; said Flip.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Flip, and got all red. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
love!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flip!&#8221; said Martha Mary, so surprised that
she almost tumbled off her throne. &#8220;Only grown-ups
fall in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am grown-up. I&#8217;m more than twenty-four
years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that old enough?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;Yes, if the person you love is more sensible
than you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she? And is she nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice! Martha Mary, let me tell you about
her. In the first place, she is very small for such
a grown-up person. She looks no more than
fifteen, but she is all of twenty years old. And
she is so fine&mdash;and really very pretty, Ladykin.
She has oodles and oodles of brown hair and the
kindest, softest brown eyes and the dearest funny
little nose and a strong, mannish jaw. You
couldn&#8217;t help liking her. And she likes nice
things; birds and flowers and books&mdash;and fairies,
too. And she likes me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told Mother Dear when you came that
you had aspirations. Mother would not tell me
what aspirations were, but now I know. She
is it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Flip. &#8220;But she has to
do with them. Shall I tell you all about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it began years and years ago. I lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
in San Francisco with a splendid father and a
mother as lovely and fine as Mother Dear. My
best friend was a little, brown-haired girl. Her
name was Janet, but that was too grown-up and
old-fashioned, so we called her Jane although
that is rather old-fashioned, too. But, you see,
Jane was an old-fashioned girl. We played the
nicest games, Martha Mary, and when we were
tired I would tell Jane stories just like I tell you.
One day a man came to Jane&#8217;s house. He stood
behind the door and listened to one of my stories.
Later he made me tell him others. When I had
finished he said that when I was older I would
be an author and write books. That became my
aspiration. I made up my mind to be an author;
not a great one who would try to change the
world, but just a simple, quiet one who could
tell stories that would make people just a little
more happy. Then, Ladykin, one night something
awful happened. I will not tell you
much about it. There came a terrible earthquake.
I don&#8217;t like to talk about it. A brick
chimney fell right on my mother and father&#8217;s
bed and killed them. It was awfully lonely then.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
I had learned to love Jane meanwhile but I was
quite poor and so I had to go away. I couldn&#8217;t
make money writing stories because my work was
not good enough and I was not known. So I decided
to work on a farm and write when I found
the time. And here I am. Now, Martha Mary,
guess what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been working very hard every night
on my stories all the time I have been here. Did
you see the envelope the postman brought for
me this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was from the publishers who print books.
They have really and truly bought my stories and
sent a perfectly good check and&mdash;I am an author.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Mary&#8217;s eyes were all watery. &#8220;Flip,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I am so happy I have to hug you.&#8221;
She hugged him and then remembered about her
birthday.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you and excuse you altogether for
forgetting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your secret is the nicest
thing that has happened to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is not the secret.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Flip. Is there more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so excited when my letter came that
Mother Dear said when she heard of it&mdash;guess
what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said I could &#8217;phone to Jane and tell
her to come right down so that she could tell
me how happy she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she! I should just say so! She is on
her way now and will be here in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Martha Mary; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
that so many wonderful things could happen in
one day. Now I want to call the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flip blew the horn and across the lawn came
all of the queen&#8217;s court.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know the secret,&#8221; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;But it is
nice. Someone is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Mick,&#8221; shouted Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. It is a girl-person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we know her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;No, but you will and you will like her,&#8221; said
Flip. &#8220;Her name is Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish an hour was not so long,&#8221; said Martha
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said John, &#8220;if you told us a story,
Philip, it wouldn&#8217;t seem so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Flip. Then because it was a
birthday and Martha Mary was queen, he told a
queen story with Kings and Knights and Ladies.
This was it:</p>

<p>IN WHICH IS TOLD THE STORY OF ALFRED OF THE<br />
LOW COUNTRY, AND JANICE, WHO LOVED THE<br />
QUEEN&#8217;S PAGE</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">In</span> the days of the good and splendid King
Arthur there was an old letter-writer named
Baudin. He lived in a small garden below the
Castle wall, and the loveliest hollyhocks and jasmine
grew about the door of the cottage. He
had everything he desired and that was not a
great deal. His business was to write letters;
love letters and business letters for the Knights
and Ladies who had never been to school and
could not write for themselves. His daughter
was a very pretty little sunshiny girl who kept
his house in order and cooked his meals. She
sang as she worked and was always happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, what was her name?&#8221; asked Martha
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name? Why, I have really forgotten.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;Was it Jane? I should like it to be Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane? Now, perhaps, it was. Or Janice. I
think it must have been Janice in those days.
So we will call her that. Janice used to do her
work early in the morning so that she might spend
the afternoon sewing or caring for the garden
flowers. Next to her father she loved flowers
more than anything else in this wide, wide world.
They were happiness, just as the song of the birds
and the shining of Lady Rumdidoodledum and
the other stars is happiness. Janice was so very
happy that she never wished to have things
changed. She wanted to go on forever caring
for her father and living in the cottage by the
Castle wall. True, at times, she thought of the
lad who hoped to marry her some day, but he does
not come into the story for a long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day, as Janice was sitting under a
cypress tree, a handsome Knight came down the
road, mounted on a splendid black horse. The
stranger wore a blue satin jerkin, black knee-breeches,
and stockings of blue. There was gold
braid on his suit and a golden tassel dangling
on his hat. From the brim waved a lovely grey-blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
plume. Very straight he rode, and dignified,
looking neither to right nor left. As he passed
the cottage Janice looked up and saw that the
black horse was very tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kind Sir,&#8217; she said, and blushed at her boldness,
&#8216;your horse is worn with the heat. May I
fetch him water?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Knight looked down and when he saw
lovely Janice he swept his plumed hat to his
breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lady,&#8217; said he, &#8216;your kindness well becomes
your fairness. If you will but show me to the
well I shall thank you and carry the water myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Janice curtsied and led him through the ivy-covered
gate, bringing a bucket to the trough
for him. When he had filled it and would carry
it out she took it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good Sir,&#8217; she said, &#8216;you may spill it and
harm your beautiful suit. I will bear it for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Knight bowed. &#8216;Our Good Lady would
be annoyed,&#8217; said he, &#8216;were I to appear before
her in disarray. It were best that I do not soil
myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Janice took the pail and smiled to herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
at the conceit of the good Knight. While
the horse drank the girl rubbed its silky coat and
patted its neck. Then the Knight bowed again
and sprang to his saddle. Janice curtsied and
went in to darn her father&#8217;s sox.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may think she would be excited at having
aided a Knight of King Arthur&#8217;s Round
Table, but she was not at all. She thought much
of the splendid black horse but not at all of its
conceited master. With him, however, it was
different. When he had ridden away he could
not forget the girl&#8217;s beauty and he saw her face
wherever he went. He became very unhappy,
then, for he found himself very much in love,
and a Knight of Arthur&#8217;s Court could never
marry the daughter of a letter-writer. Every day
he rode by the cottage and saw Janice under the
trees, sewing or trimming flowers. He would
sweep his hat to his breast and she would bow
without smiling, although often she came out with
a pail of water for the horse. Naturally the
more the Knight saw her the more he loved her,
and the more miserable he became.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the birthday of Guinivere, Arthur&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Queen, there was a royal tournament planned,
with fencing and lance bouts and dancing on the
oak lawns. Tents were raised and they flew
the Queen&#8217;s colors: a pavilion was built with a
canopied box where the Queen sat surrounded
by her Ladies and attendants. All morning there
were gaming and May dances. In the early
afternoon the Queen&#8217;s Herald blew a blast on his
silver trumpet and announced the Queen&#8217;s bout in
which all Knights might compete. The prize was
to be a crimson ribbon from Guinivere and the
granting of any request in her power that the
winner might make. Again the Herald blew a
blast and out from the tents came the Knights
astride the finest of Arabian and Russian horses.
Their lances were under their arms; their Ladies&#8217;
colors on their sleeves. To the center of the oak
lawn they charged where the din of fighting and
the crashing of lances against shields became so
uproarious that one could scarcely hear the cheers
of the spectators. For an hour they fought until
Alfred of The Low Country&mdash;(that being the name
of the Knight who loved Janice)&mdash;and Herbert of
The Blue Feather, were left. Again and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
they charged&mdash;lance met shield and shield glanced
off lance, till suddenly, Alfred&#8217;s horse reared and
Knight Alfred slid to the ground. He sprang up
and struck the animal across the haunches with
his lance, so that the horse dashed away across
the field. Then Alfred threw down his lance
and drew a dagger, all shiny and sharp. Immediately
Knight Herbert sprang to the ground
with his dagger drawn and they fell to fighting
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile Alfred&#8217;s horse, freed of his rider,
whinnied a moment, then stampeded toward the
further edge of the oak lawn where the villagers
and their wives and daughters were gathered to
see the sports. Right into the center of them
he rushed, directly at Janice, who stood terrified
at the side of the old letter-writer. The crowd
cried out in fear when, just as the horse reached
and would have trampled Janice to the ground,
a page boy, who had stolen away from his place
by Queen Guinivere, dashed forward, grasped the
horse by the mane, and stopped his rush. Only
a moment the animal hesitated, then turned his
head and sprang forward into the field again with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the boy clinging to his mane with all his might.
The steed plunged and reared and finally, just
as he was captured by guards who rushed forward,
he shook the boy off. The page lay where
he had fallen, his head buried in his arm. Past
the guard and out to him, Janice rushed and
sank down and took his wounded head on her
knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, across the field, the combat had
continued as though nothing else had happened.
But King Arthur had seen all and determined
to reward the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thrusting and sparring, Alfred of The Lowland
and Herbert of the Blue Feather fought,
till suddenly Alfred&#8217;s dagger pierced his opponent&#8217;s
side and Herbert fell, bleeding. Alfred was
winner of the tournament.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Guinivere he came, flushed and happy, and
kneeled before her. He kissed her hand, offering
her, at the same time, his victorious dagger. She
smiled and took the weapon, then pinned to
Alfred&#8217;s sleeve the red ribbon she wore at her
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Arise, Sir Conqueror,&#8217; she said. &#8216;Ask of me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
what you will and if it be in my power I shall
grant it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My Lady,&#8217; said Alfred, &#8216;all things are in
your power; the very birds sing when you smile
upon them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Flatterer,&#8217; said Guinivere. &#8216;You frighten
me, I fear you are going to ask a very great
favor of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For me,&#8217; said Alfred, &#8216;it will be greater
than vast estates. For you, Dear Queen, it will be
little more than a spoken word. I ask that you
raise Janice, daughter of Baudin, the letter-writer,
to my rank, so that I may marry her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your wish shall be granted,&#8217; said the Queen.
&#8216;You may go to your love, and tell her my
pleasure.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Across the field, on his black horse, went Alfred,
to find Janice on her knees, bathing and
bandaging the page&#8217;s head. She rose as Alfred
approached. He bowed proudly and sprang to
the ground. Before all the gathered villagers,
he spoke, saying to Baudin, the father:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good man, the Queen, knowing the love
that is in my heart for your daughter, has ordained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
that she be raised to my rank so that I
may make her my wife.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Baudin became so embarrassed that he
could hardly speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The honor you do us is great, Good Knight,&#8217;
he said. &#8216;It is very wonderful tidings, you bring.
Janice, my child, what say you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Verily, we are deeply honored,&#8217; she said.
&#8216;And we thank you and beg you to ask the forgiveness
of my Lady, the Queen, but I do not
love you, Sir Knight; I would ask that you do
not demand that I marry you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Great Saints!&#8217; shouted Alfred. &#8216;Am I to
understand that you refuse a chance to marry
with one of my station and bearing? Strike me,
but you are a proud one and the more to be desired.
Sir, what say you of the girl&#8217;s nonsense?
Command her to rise up and go to the Queen that
she may be made of high rank and a fitting bride
for me!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sir Knight,&#8217; said old Baudin, now very
proud and calm, &#8216;I am the father of my child&#8217;s
happiness, not the keeper of her heart. Her wish
is my wish ever. She will thank our good Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
for her graciousness and beg to decline the honor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We shall see,&#8217; said Alfred. &#8216;Come, I shall
lead you to the Queen. Perhaps her Gracious
Self will be able to drive this stupidity out of
your head.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Janice put her fingers in his and allowed him
to lead her to the Queen&#8217;s box. At Guinivere&#8217;s
feet sat the page, his head bandaged, his chin in
his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janice kneeled and bowed her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, kindest of queens,&#8217; she whispered. &#8216;I
thank you for your favor. I am honored more
than my dreams had ever hoped for. But I beg,
Dear Lady, that you will not demand my acceptance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I do not understand,&#8217; said Guinivere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Janice told her that she did not love the
Knight; that she loved the page who had saved
her and who had loved her long and secretly. She
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dear Queen, on this, your birthday, when you
are trying to make all the world happy, do not
force me to accept the kind offer of this good
Knight. Let me go back to my father&#8217;s garden.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;As she spoke, Knight Alfred had become red
and furious. He spoke, finally, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I take back my request, O Queen. I could
never take to wife a hussy who would bestow
her love upon a page. I do not wish her; I ask
no other prize than your red ribbon and your
kind thoughts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sir,&#8217; said Guinivere, &#8216;your request shall be
granted. And,&#8217; she said, turning to the page,
&#8216;you, sir. Do you love this girl?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;As I love the music of the winds and the
birds and your voice,&#8217; said the page.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then,&#8217; said Guinivere, &#8216;for your bravery you
may have her and make her your wife.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The page kneeled, first at the feet of the
Queen and then before Janice. She rested her
trembling fingers on his shoulders and kissed him
upon the brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then arose King Arthur.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lad,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you have pleased me twice
to-day: firstly in saving, secondly in loving this
child. Therefore, I shall grant you whatever you
wish. Think well! What does your heart most
desire?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Sire,&#8217; said the page, rising and bowing humbly,
&#8216;I am allowed to serve the fairest queen and
the bravest king in the world. I am loved by the
dearest maiden in the kingdom. I have nothing
to ask; there is no more I desire of Life but to
live and die for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well spoken,&#8217; said Arthur, the King.
Then he turned to Janice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know not which of you is the more fortunate,&#8217;
he said. &#8216;Life should hold much for you.
Go, then, with your husband, and remember that
Arthur ordains that you shall honor, respect,
and ever love him, and be happy, both of you,
always.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they were!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Of course they were,&#8221; said a strange voice
when Flip had finished. &#8220;If they loved each
other they couldn&#8217;t help but be happy always.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children all jumped up and looked through
the trees. There was a girl standing there; a
brown-haired girl with laughing eyes and a jaw
just like a man&#8217;s. Martha Mary knew who it
was right away. It was Jane. Even if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
weren&#8217;t sure you could tell by the color of Flip&#8217;s
face. He stood up, all red, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, child,&#8221; and shook hands with her, just
like a couple of almost strangers would do. Then
he introduced her to the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane, this is John Sherman, by far the most
important member of the family. John, this is
Jane. And this, Jane, is Martha Mary, but we
will call her Sister. These are the almost twins:
Edward Lee who dips cats in whitewash, and
Walter, who puts new spots on them with blue
ink. This is Liza alias Elizabeth alias Butterfly.
And this, if you please, is Hermit. You know
he was really the one who discovered me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hermit, when he heard his name, got up and
yawned, then wagged his tail and smiled as politely
as could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary, when they were
all introduced. &#8220;It&#8217;s my birthday and we should
like you to stay and help me celebrate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jane has&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Flip started to
grumble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane has nothing, Young Man,&#8221; said Jane.
&#8220;I know you are all on edges to show me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
proofs of your book and tell me how wonderful
you are, but you will have to wait. I&#8217;m going to
celebrate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Flip. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go jump in
the lake&mdash;or eat a snail or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was John who saved the day. &#8220;Last one
to the stable is it and a nigger-baby,&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>Away rushed all the children, and Jane would
have followed, but her skirts were too tight.
So she sat on the haystack next to Flip and
when Martha Mary turned around just once, she
saw&mdash;but Martha Mary would not tell us what she
saw.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>IN WHICH JANE STAYS LONGER THAN SHE HAD<br />
EXPECTED TO AND WE ENTERTAIN HER. AS<br />
USUAL, FLIP TELLS A STORY</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Everyone</span> was rather anxious to see how
Mother Dear would receive Jane. Mother did
not take to strange women as a general thing,
but, as Flip explained later, Jane was hardly
a woman, so it made matters easy. Flip was the
only one who was embarrassed. He almost ruined
his hat, twisting it out of shape, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Sherman, this is Jane Houghton. I hope
you will like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman shook hands with Jane, and the
grip of the two women was like the grip of two
men. Jane was not at all ill-at-ease. Then Mrs.
Sherman put her two hands on Jane&#8217;s shoulders
and suddenly kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>Walter giggled and turned a handspring.</p>

<p>And so, instead of taking the afternoon train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
back, Jane was invited to stay as the Shermans&#8217;
guest until Monday. Of course, Mother Dear
explained that it was because Martha Mary had
asked it and it was her birthday, but I think
Mother was romantic and liked to see Jane and
Flip together. You can never tell what these
grown-ups are thinking!</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon, Flip hitched up the do-si-do-cart
and in piled all the children, with Jane
and Flip, and they went on the loveliest picnic
they had ever had. Parts of it were a surprise.
For example, they had had no idea that Mother
Dear and Father were invited, but when they
reached the Cypress trees near the ocean beach,
at sunset, the first thing they saw was Mother
standing near a campfire that Father had built.
There was the most wonderful smell in the air;
it was like fried bacon, and fried bacon it was.
There was green corn, too, roasted in the fire,
and chicken cooked on a forked stick, and watermelon
and pancakes and heaps of doughnuts.
Everyone ate as much as they could, and then
Father lit his pipe and Mother sat on the ground
next to him and the Children all lay on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
stomachs on the sand, with Jane and Flip, to
watch the moon come up over the ocean. Once,
when he thought no one was looking, Flip kissed
Jane on the ear, but Edward Lee caught him,
and for punishment Flip had to tell a story. He
grumbled and said it was too nice a night to
spoil with his nonsense, but when Jane said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Dear,&#8221; he couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is to be a story of the trees,&#8221; said Flip.</p>

<p>John sniffed. &#8220;You always tell about things
that are not alive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Father doesn&#8217;t.
Neither does Captain Mick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, John,&#8221; said Martha Mary, very much
surprised, &#8220;the trees are alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They could, once,&#8221; said Flip. &#8220;And they still
do talk in their own language, but of course you
cannot understand them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can Father?&#8221; asked Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you, Flip?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I know what they mean to say.
Listen, now, and I will try to finish the story
before anyone interrupts again. Elizabeth, stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
sticking things in Hermit&#8217;s ear! Now&mdash;where
was I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hadn&#8217;t started,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; then I&#8217;ll start with once, years and
years ago. It was in a large forest, way up in
the mountains, where there are only wild things
and no men. The trees grow very tall and straight
there; the branches are heavy and the trunks
all covered with grey moss, and everything else
is green. The forest, many years ago, was ruled
by a lovely princess. Her name was Shade of
the Mountain Lake and she was a large, lovely,
blue crane. The trees just called her &#8216;Princess,&#8217;
because that was easy to say when the wind
hummed in the branches, and &#8216;Shade of the
Mountain Lake&#8217; was much too long. Princess
ruled her tree land for many years and the wood-folk
were glad that they had chosen her, because
she was so wise and graceful and lovely. You
see, her soft breast feathers were colored with
the blue of the sky of a Spring morning, and
the grey of her slender neck was taken from the
shaded spots near an old mountain. The green of
her eyes once belonged to two splendid emeralds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and when the emeralds lost their color they became
priceless diamonds. So how could Princess
help but be beautiful?</p>

<p>&#8220;She was very proud of her kingdom; of the
tall green trees and the blue-green lake and the
very blue sky. All day she would fly over the
hills, smiling on her people, sailing here and there,
down and up, sometimes almost to the sun. One
day, when she was very high in the Heavens,
she saw, way off across the valley, a spot of red.
That was a color that was not known in the
mountains, so she flew with the wind, out across
her valley and another valley until she came to a
land where men lived. And there, what do you
think she saw? Fields and fields and fields of the
loveliest wild flowers, all golden and purple and
pink, and gardens with red, red roses, and sweet-smelling
lilacs climbing over the stone walls, and
soft-colored fruit blossoms&mdash;there were more flowers
than days in a hundred years. All afternoon
she flew over the gardens, smelling the perfumes
and always finding something new to surprise
her. When night came she flew back to
her kingdom in the mountains. But she was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
sad, for she had thought her land the loveliest
in the world and now she knew that it had none
of the wonderful flowers that grew in the man&#8217;s
world. All night she grieved and in the morning
called her council to her&mdash;a branch of a pine
and a branch of a redwood and a branch of the
single oak that grew at the foot of the mountain.
She told them how she had spent the day and
how very, very much she wished her land to have
all the colors and not only the green in Spring
and the brown in Autumn. Then the branch of
the single oak spoke and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me help you. The Pine has always
been the most plentiful tree in the mountains and
the Redwood has been the tallest. I have been
out of place and able to do but little save giving
shade. Now I think I can help.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She whispered her idea to Princess, and when
Princess heard she was so pleased that she soared
high into the sky and sang to the morning sun.
Then down again she flew, and told the silver
stream her secret. And this is what she did:</p>

<p>&#8220;First she went to the single oak and took
from it several fine, green branches, all covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
with fresh leaves. These she carried one at a
time up the side of the hill and laid them side
by side on the grass. Then she called to the sun
and he came over the treetops and warmed the
oak leaves with his golden light. When they were
all glowing Princess called to the clouds and asked
for just a little rain. Down it came, so very
quietly that not even the sun went away. And
so the drops, falling through the sunshine to the
oak leaves, formed a lovely rainbow. Then the
rain stopped, but the rainbow remained, coloring
the oak leaves with blue and red and gold and
amber and violet. Princess was so happy, then,
that she could hardly wait to carry the beautiful
colored sprays into the forest to plant them at
the foot of the tall trees. All the wood-folk&mdash;the
rabbits and the snakes and the silly young
bears&mdash;came out to watch her as she worked.
When her task was through she called all her
subjects to her and introduced them to the new
color she had brought into the mountains, and
she called it Child of The Oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child of The Oak grew very much in a short
time. She had the form of a clinging vine; up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
over the branches of the other trees she crept,
just like a really and truly baby. Her colors
were the loveliest you have ever seen. Just think
of leaves that were golden red as the loveliest poppies
and green as the wildest hillside and violet
like the softest field flowers and blue like the
morning sky. She was so beautiful that all the
trees grew to love her in a very short time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, one day, the most awful thing happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was early morning in the month of May.
Across the further valley and right through the
Valley of Shade of The Mountain Lake and up
the hillside and into the mountain land, came a
whole school of children, to the place where no
man had ever been before. It was very nice at
first. They sang songs about Angels and Fairies
and the one that went like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first1">&#8220;I&#8217;ll sing you a song of the fields in the Spring</div>
<div class="verse">With a chatter of birds in the treetops,</div>
<div class="verse">And the poppies and daisies will dance as I sing</div>
<div class="verse">And the birdlings will warble and flutter a wing</div>
<div class="verse">And the sleepy, fat owl will wake up, the old thing!</div>
<div class="verse">As I sing to the birds, the gay happy birds,</div>
<div class="verse">The silly young birds in the tree tops.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;Then they tied ribbons to the tallest pine
and took hold of the ends and danced a May
dance, and their pink and white dresses, with
their baby cheeks all flushed, and their golden
hair waving, they looked just like the South
Wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course such nice things could never
last. Pretty soon one of the children found a
spray of Child of The Oak and plucked it
and carried it to the awfully awesome person
who was in charge of the party. She said it
was:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Remarkably beautiful and most ethereal,&#8217;
and, although I haven&#8217;t an idea what that means,
I know by the way she said it that it must be
something hateful. Back she sent the children
to gather as much as they could find. They
rushed about tearing Child of The Oak up by
the roots and it hurt just as much as though someone
were to pull Liza&#8217;s hair. The tall trees all
hung their heads so they wouldn&#8217;t see Child of
The Oak suffer and the Mother Oak moaned
and held out her arms, but of course no human
being could understand her. It was so pitiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
so unfair, and no one knew the least thing to do.
And then, what do you think? Guess what,
Edward Lee! What do you think, Walter? Oh,
you never can guess!</p>

<p>&#8220;Down from the top of the mountain came the
North Wind. Princess went to him, weeping, and,
&#8216;Father Wind,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;can&#8217;t you help Child
of The Oak?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Certainly,&#8217; said North Wind. Down to the
May party he swept and blew deep breaths of
the pollen that grows on dryads&#8217; wings all over
the Child of Oak branches. The pollen that grows
on dryads&#8217; wings is deadly poison, you know.
So, as soon as the children touched it, they became
ill; they found spots of red on their arms,
and their faces became swollen as though they
had mumps. They itched simply miserably, and
all went home sick, and had to be put to bed
with salves all over them. And so, they never
dared touch Child of The Oak again, because
the North Wind had put the poison on her to
protect her. When the men came to the mountains
they never touched the lovely colored leaves,
for they called them &#8216;Poison Oak.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;But Princess did not mind, because she knew
that the real name was Child of The Oak and
that Child of The Oak was the loveliest child in
all the hill world.&#8221;</p>

<p>IN WHICH WALTER DOES NOT WANT NINE EIGHTS<br />
TO BE SEVENTY-TWO; AND MARTHA MARY FEELS<br />
SO BADLY FOR HIM THAT SHE GOES TO SEEK<br />
ADVENTURE. SHE FINDS IT</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> all happened because Walter couldn&#8217;t learn
how many times eight was seventy-two. The eight
tables are hard enough, but when it comes to dividing
by eight even John made mistakes at times.
Walter insisted that eight sevens were seventy-two.
Mother Dear said they were not, but Walter
said he knew best. Mother Dear looked sorry
and said if Walter were quite positive he was
right, then she supposed he must be, but she had
learned that nine eights were seventy-two.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not,&#8221; said stubborn Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they then, Dear?&#8221; asked Mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;But I won&#8217;t
have them seventy-two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mother Dear almost lost her patience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Very well, Walter,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But, if you
cannot believe your mother, I hardly think it
worth while helping you, so you may leave the
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter lost his temper altogether and went
out, slamming the door and kicking his feet.
Later, Martha Mary, who felt as badly for him
as she did for Mother Dear, although she knew
Mother was right, found him in the hayloft, with
a miserable look in his eyes and a smudge of dirt
where tears had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Brother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t feel
badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;I hate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walter,&#8221; pleaded Martha Mary, &#8220;you
shouldn&#8217;t. It hurts when you are that way.
Please come play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;Get out of here; I
hate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Really miserable and almost crying herself,
Martha Mary crept away to find the rest of the
family. Father was busy writing Things in a
large book. Mother Dear was bathing Liza;
John was rowing Edward Lee on the lake Ocean.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; he called. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear
you. I am miles away.&#8221;</p>

<p>More unhappy than before, Martha Mary
walked down the gravel path to the gate. Then
she opened it, a thing she rarely did, and went
out. It was rather dusty on the county road,
and the wind was blowing, and it fluffed her hair
all about her face. It felt good&mdash;the wind always
does. Almost immediately Martha Mary became
more cheerful, and as soon as she became cheerful
she had an idea. They always come when
one is happy. She made up her mind to have
an adventure; she didn&#8217;t know exactly what it
would be, but an adventure she would have. She
had never had a really and truly one all to herself;
John had them; so did Walter and Edward
Lee, like whitewashing and inking the cat, or finding
a bird&#8217;s nest in the old straw hat in the hayloft.
But nothing had ever really happened to
Martha Mary and she didn&#8217;t know just how to
begin. She thought for a long time; then a brown
squirrel popped up in the middle of the road,
cocked its ears, and scampered into the poppy
field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow &#8216;him,&#8217;&#8221; decided Martha Mary,
&#8220;and see what happens. Perhaps it will be like
Alice in Wonderland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away the two of them went, lickety-split, down
a hillside and up another to the crest and over it.
Right there, just on the other side&mdash;&mdash; Guess
what! There was a group of children, at least
a dozen, all of the boys in blue jumpers and the
girls in blue Kate Greenaway dresses, and they
were gathered around one of the boys who was
a little bigger than the others; even bigger than
John. He was talking quite excitedly, and
Martha Mary stood, fascinated, watching him
and quite forgot little Mr. Squirrel, who had by
this time completely disappeared up a tree.
Finally the big boy saw Martha Mary and took
off his hat and said, &#8220;Hullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>

<p>Again the boy said, &#8220;Hullo!&#8221; and looked at
the tips of his shoes; then suddenly he smiled
a perfectly good smile and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you could tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, what?&#8221; asked Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are hunting for wild violets and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
don&#8217;t seem to be any. Do you know where they
grow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Martha Mary knew. There were
oodles and oodles of them on the Sherman Place,
just at the edge of the lake Ocean. She thought
it would be lovely to bring all of the children
home to pick them and perhaps, if there was
enough, to have tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t your Mother care?&#8221; asked the
big boy. &#8220;Or are you like us? Haven&#8217;t you
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Mary could hardly believe her ears.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t any of you mothers?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Nor fathers, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How awful!&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;Where
do you live? Who takes care of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We live at the Charity,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;We
take care of ourselves, excepting at meal-time or
lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice!&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;Can anyone
live there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;if you are an orphan.
But it&#8217;s not nice. No one takes an interest or
anything in you. The only excitement is when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
ladies with eyeglasses on sticks come from the
Affiliated Charities to pat you on the head and
say, &#8216;Dear little shaver,&#8217; and make you want
to run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they look to see if your ears are clean,&#8221;
said one little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ask if you are good and say your prayers,&#8221;
said another.</p>

<p>&#8220;And of course we say &#8216;Yes,&#8217;&#8221; said the big
boy, &#8220;and then they give us pennies and tell us
to save them and we will be rich when we grow
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not true,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;You
always spend them before you grow up. Things
are very expensive! I know!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they remembered the violets, so down the
hills and to the road they scampered, Martha
Mary at the head of the lot (to be exact, there
were six boys and eight girls). Through the
gates and up to the house she took them to introduce
them to Mother Dear, who was still feeling
pretty badly at the way Walter had behaved.
When she saw Martha Mary with all her company
she dropped her sewing and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;What in the world has the child done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Mary told her as quickly as she could
all about their being orphans and about the violets
and the affiliated ladies who gave them pennies
to save. Mother Dear&#8217;s eyes grew soft in the
way they have and she kissed Martha Mary and
shook hands with the children, no matter how dirty
they were. She told Martha Mary to take them
to the violets by the lake and not let them fall
in, for some of them were quite small and liable
to. Martha Mary promised, then called Edward
Lee and John and they brought along Walter,
who was now in a sensible frame of mind. John
was inclined to be standoffish until Martha Mary,
who knew him like a book, told him that the biggest
little boy liked men better than women, and
then John became quite nice.</p>

<p>In a little while Martha Mary had learned the
names of all the orphans, and I&#8217;ll tell them to
you, although you&#8217;ll no doubt forget.</p>

<p>First there was the biggest little boy; he was
called &#8220;Slats,&#8221; because he was thin. The Home
name for him was Thomas Dorne. Then there
was the biggest little girl, Helen Dolittle, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Reddy Smith and Sammy O&#8217;Reilly and Sue Patience
Grey and John Shaw and Margaret something&mdash;her
parents had died before she was able
to find out what the last name was&mdash;and Pansy
and Amy Rebecca Isaacs and Skinny Dawson and
Patrick O&#8217;Harahan, and finally the most adorable
little golden-haired girl I have ever seen and her
name was awful. It was Dolcerina Vennicci, but
they called her &#8220;Piffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Away went the eighteen children to the edge
of the lake, where there were so many violets
under the green leaves that everyone fell to picking
and became too busy to talk. After a while,
when hats and arms and aprons were full of flowers,
Martha Mary said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play skin the Fox,&#8221; said Skinny Dawson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ich tee goo,&#8221; said Piffy. &#8220;Ich tee goo&#8221; means
something like &#8220;Oof&#8221; or &#8220;Horrid&#8221; or &#8220;Dirty&#8221;
or &#8220;Creepy&#8221; or &#8220;Slimy.&#8221; So you could tell what
she meant, although I confess it&#8217;s hard to find the
word that explains it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll play ring around a rosy,&#8221; said Amy
Rebecca.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;Sissy game!&#8221; said Slats.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; said Martha Mary. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell them?&#8221; asked Sue Patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not exactly, but Flip can. Perfectly
wonderful ones!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Flip?&#8221; they all wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; said Martha Mary. Away
she rushed and in a moment she was back, dragging
Flip after her and he holding in his hand
the pages of a letter from Jane that he had not
had half time enough to read twice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, You!&#8221; he said to them all, without
waiting for an introduction. You see, Mother
Dear had told him that they were there and that
he must be nice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want a story!&#8221; they all shouted.</p>

<p>Flip turned to Martha Mary and struck a pose
like an old-time actor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! Madam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my fame precedes
me. I fain would accommodate you, but it wearies
me to ever seek new plots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be hateful,&#8221; said Martha Mary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well,&#8221; said Flip. &#8220;What nature of story-do
you desire?&#8221;</p>

<p>They all shouted at once: &#8220;Pirates&mdash;dolls&mdash;fairies&mdash;ghosts&mdash;love&mdash;shipwreck&mdash;creepy&mdash;bloody&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
until you couldn&#8217;t tell who was
talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; roared Flip. &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect me
to think if you don&#8217;t be quiet. I&#8217;m going to tell
just the kind of a story I wish and, if you don&#8217;t
like it, you can go jump in the lake and drown.
But I hope you won&#8217;t, because then I&#8217;ll be insulted.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the story he told them:</p>

<p>IN WHICH ANOTHER JOHN AND ANOTHER MARY<br />
WANDER FURTHER FROM HOME THAN THEY<br />
EVER HAVE BEEN BEFORE, AND FIND A MARVELOUS<br />
BALL OF GLASS, IN WHICH ONE SEES<br />
THE STRANGEST THINGS</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Way</span> off in the furthest corner of San Francisco,
just where the sun comes over to light up
the bay, there is a hill. Of course there are many
other hills in San Francisco, but none of them
quite so important as Russian Hill. You see, the
families who live there are quieter and happier
and more old-fashioned than those in other parts
of the city. I don&#8217;t know why; they just are.
Right at the steepest part of the hill, and you
can believe me when I tell you the Hill is steep,
there is a Spanish Castle; not a really and truly
one, but just exactly as nice as though it were.
No one lived in it, nor had for several years, excepting
an old, white-haired caretaker; a splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
man. He liked children. That is why John and
Mary were allowed in the Castle so much. John
was a rather spoiled, selfish boy who lived in
the Mansion next to the Castle, with his married
sister. Mary was his best friend. She had
freckles and you would have liked her. They
played nice games up on the Hill; dozens of fascinating
make-believes that you never would have
thought of. They fought pirates&mdash;oodles of them&mdash;and
baked potatoes in ovens under the rock and
did other things just as nice.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, just like other children, they grew tired
of these things at times and wanted something
new. So one day, when there were no potatoes
left, Mary suggested going down the Hill. John
did not like to; he hated to go where there were
other people. Mary laughed at him and told him
he was a sissy, although he wasn&#8217;t really. He
became ashamed of her taunts, so down the Hill
they went. First you go down some lovely old
steps cut right in the stone, then you come to
another hill so steep that it is easier to lie down
and roll than to walk. They must have gone at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
least six blocks when, all at once, Mary said to
John:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are not in San Francisco any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where are we, then?&#8217; asked John.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are in China.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not really; they were in Chinatown,
but it looked like another city, altogether.
There were hundreds of Chinamen shuffling along
the street, with long pig-tails and funny, large
pipes in their mouths. They talked in a queer
sing-song, the funniest language you have ever
heard. There were Chinese women with gold
jewelry and green jade in their hair, and the most
adorable little Chinese babies, who looked like
dolls, dressed in splendid colored silks. Up on
a balcony, where there were a dozen brightly
lighted lanterns, a Chinese musician was playing
upon an instrument that sounded like dying pigs
and broken drums and tin whistles. In the shop-windows
there were white lilies and flaming
oriental silks and queer toys. Also there were
skinned pigs and skinned chickens and strings of
bacon hanging from nails.</p>

<p>&#8220;John and Mary became so interested that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
forgot all about going home. Before they knew
it, darkness had fallen, lanterns on the balconies
were lighted, and Chinatown looked like Fairyland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down the street came a tall, fine-looking
Chinaman, in loose, blue silk trousers and a blue
silk coat with black embroidery. He seemed very
much surprised to find two American children in
Chinatown at that time of night. He came to
them and said, in even better English than I use:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I assume that your small selves are lost. Is
it not so?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not exactly,&#8217; said Mary, who was always
the spokesman. &#8216;You see, we came for a walk
and just sort of stumbled into Fairyland and now
we don&#8217;t want to go home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But your August Parent? Will he not be
worried?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Mary, &#8216;although John&#8217;s sister will
not mind.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So,&#8217; said the Chinaman. &#8216;Well, perhaps, if
we were to &#8217;phone to the August Parent, he might
feel relief. Then we could perhaps have tea and
ginger before returning.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;&#8216;That would be lovely,&#8217; said Mary, and,
&#8216;Great,&#8217; said John.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the Chinaman stepped into a store and
&#8217;phoned to Mr. Devine, Mary&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is Fong Kee, Doctor of Law of the
Hong Kong University,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I have just
found young John and Mary enjoying the sights
of Stockton Street. I beg that you will have no
worriment, as I shall give them tea and bring
them home at an early hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;John and Mary could not hear what Mr.
Devine said, but it must have been satisfactory,
for Mr. Fong Kee came out of the booth, smiling,
and took a hand of each of the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now,&#8217; he said, &#8216;we shall visit my worthy
friend, Fong Charles.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They went down a flight of narrow steps into
a dark basement. There was an odor of punks,
like one uses on the Fourth of July, and the strong
breath of China Lilies. In through a latticed
door went Fong Kee, with Mary and John clinging
to each other&#8217;s hands, just the least bit
frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;The room they came to was decorated in beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
golden scrolls of carved wood. At the end
of the room was a queer wooden man, and at
his feet was a bowl from which came a long ribbon
of beautiful blue smoke. On a wooden couch another
Chinaman was resting, smoking a small
bronze pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fong Kee spoke to him in Chinese and he
arose and shook hands with John and Mary.
Then he struck a metal bell and a Chinese slave
girl appeared. He ordered her to bring tea and
ginger. Then he turned to John.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am the old Fong Charles,&#8217; he said. &#8216;More
years I have lived in San Francisco than there
are hairs on an old pig&#8217;s tail. I welcome you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You look pretty old,&#8217; said John. &#8216;What do
you do? Are you a cook?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; smiled Fong Charles. &#8216;I am a philosopher.
I dream&mdash;and smoke my pipes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I like nice dreams,&#8217; said Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So!&#8217; said Fong Charles. &#8216;Then, perhaps,
while we await Sanka, my servant, who is as slow
as the race of the turtles, I might tell you a dream
or two.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He lifted John and Mary to a black wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
table, where they sat, cross-legged, like tailors.
Then he put between them a small black pedestal,
on which rested a large, round ball of glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So,&#8217; said Fong Charles. &#8216;Into the dream
glass you must look and the dreams you shall
see.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;John and Mary leaned forward and saw in
the glass hundreds of lovely colors, as though the
rainbow had broken in it. Then the colors divided
and circled about like a fairy dance. Softly, oh,
so very softly! Fong Charles began to speak, in
his sing-song voice, stopping only to draw at his
pipe and blow a bit of smoke into the curtains
above his head. And as he spoke, little by little,
figures became clear in the glass until John and
Mary could see the dreams, just as Fong Charles
told them. There were three dreams he told,
all quite short and strange:</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Dream of The Girl&#8217;s Gift</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Out of Ta Chung Sz, which is, August One,
the Temple of the Bell, came Tchi Niu, the Bellmaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Those of you who are pure of heart,&#8217; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
called, &#8216;bring to me your metal mirrors that I
may make of them a new bell. Come, my children.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;They came, many of them and gladly, the
daughters and the mothers, bearing in their arms
the mirrors that showed their beauty, for it was
honorable to give, and what more worthy gift could
be made than a new bell for the temple?</p>

<p>&#8220;Tcho-Kow came last and slowly. On the mound
of mirrors she placed hers and stood aside. Then,
as the torch was carried to the fire builded to melt
the mirrors, her heart grew sad, for the mirror
she had brought was the mirror that had been
in her mother&#8217;s family and her grandmother&#8217;s
family, and the family of many generations before
that. And so she grew cold with grief and
cried out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slowly the flames crept up and slowly the
mass of metal melted into a river of shining gold.
But the mirror of Tcho-Kow would not burn.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How now,&#8217; said Tchi Niu. &#8216;The gift burns
not; you have brought disgrace on your house,
oh, daughter of a Thousand Lilies, by not giving
your heart with your gift. How, then, will you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
redeem yourself in the eyes of Dong, the Great
Bell?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then was Tcho-Kow smitten with a great repentance
and she longed for the goodwill of Dong.
So she thought and thus made her gift worthy.
As the flames crept up about the mass of metal,
she cast aside her dress and saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gladly I give myself as gift,&#8217; she stepped
into the flames and disappeared. Then did the
flames burn joyfully and the mirror of Tcho-Kow
melted with the others and Dong was appeased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now hangs the bell in Ta Chung Sz, and
when it is rung to call its song to the world:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ko-gnai, Ko-gnai, Ko-gnai,&#8217; it calls, and thus
renders thanks to Tcho-Kow for her gift.&#8221;</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Dream of Hoa-Tchao</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Kiang-Kow-Jin, who dwelled in the body of
a stork in the Pearl River, was the God of Children.
He ruled for a million years and was beloved
by all the race of River Men. He ruled
well and happily and knew no worry. Came a
year, then, when the Children of the River grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
few and Kiang-Kow-Jin grieved. So to him he
called Chung Li, the girl child, and said to
her:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I grieve because your companions are few.
What then, Daughter of Wisdom, am I to do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chung Li knew all things.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Go to Ta Chung Sz, The Temple of the Bell,
and pray,&#8217; she said, &#8216;that many flowers shall
grow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Ta Chung Sz went Kiang-Kow-Jin and
prayed, and when he came out of the Temple
all the fields were glad with myriad wondrous
colored flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is Hoa-Tchao, the Birthday of A Hundred
Flowers,&#8217; he said. Then he sought his home
and slept.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he had slept and awakened he came
again to the fields. There played Chung Li with
many new children. And so Kiang-Kow-Jin
learned that children are flowers.&#8221;</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Dream of Bo</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Bo is the God of The River Fish. His
home is of glass and seaweed. Yearly came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
River Men to make gifts to Bo, for Bo was
of great greed. One year, with the other Men
of The River, came Fong Soy, the silk merchant.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bountiful Bo,&#8217; said he, &#8216;this year I have no
gift. The rains have been few and I have sold
no silks. I have no wealth or fruits to bring
to you. So, that you will bear well with me, I
have brought that which I treasure more than Life
itself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He opened the folds of his dress and out
stepped Fong Sing, his oldest son. Fong Sing,
garbed in red, stepped into the waters and disappeared.
Then, though parted from his dearest
possession, Fong Soy returned to his home and
learned that his wife had given him two sons
and they were visaged as Bo, the God of The
River.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Slowly the forms in the crystal ball disappeared
and Fong Charles stopped speaking. John
and Mary shook themselves as though they had been
sleeping. Down from the black table Fong Kee
lifted them, and there, on a small stand, was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
black tea in lovely transparent cups. Mary tasted
it, but it was bitter, so she did not drink. Then
Sanka, the slave girl, brought dishes with cakes
and candied gingers and strange fruits and
almonds. Fong Charles filled the children&#8217;s
pockets, and then Fong Kee led them away.
Slowly they climbed their Hill and to the door
of the Mansion. There stood John&#8217;s sister and
Mary&#8217;s Father to welcome them, and you may believe
they were relieved when the children appeared.
They shook hands with Fong Kee and
made him promise that he would come again to
the Hill to visit them and perhaps, some time,
take them again to Fong Charles to look in the
round glass again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, that was a queer story,&#8221; said Slats, when
Flip had finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Piffy. &#8220;It made me sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Mary was afraid that the children would
hurt Flip&#8217;s feelings if they said more, so she raced
them up the lawn to the house, and there on the
veranda Mother Dear had placed pitchers of lemonade
and enough cake for six times eighteen
children. And so they ate till they could eat no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
more and then, with their wild violets in their
arms, went back to the Charity, with Martha
Mary&#8217;s promise that she would come to play with
them whenever Mother Dear gave her permission.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>IN WHICH FLIP USES NEEDLESSLY LONG WORDS,<br />
BUT, TO WIN OUR GOOD-WILL AGAIN, HE TELLS<br />
A REAL OLD-FASHIONED FAIRY TALE</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a perfectly good story-teller Flip had some
rather queer ideas. He didn&#8217;t believe in fairy
tales: that is, the kind that told about witches
and Godmothers and Princes and such. He said
he could not explain just why&mdash;it had something
to do with inefficient education. Of course we
do not know what &#8220;inefficient education&#8221; is, but
Father and Mother Dear know, so it must be
all right. Nevertheless, everyone knows that real
fairy tales are nice even if they are not efficient
education, so one night, about an hour before
bedtime, when the children were all in the living-room
before the fire, Martha Mary asked if,
please, Flip would tell one. Flip was in a particularly
good humor; there had been a thickish
letter from someone during the day, and of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the someone was Jane. So he agreed. Only he
was rather annoying; he started by using needlessly
long words that no one understood. He
said they would have to &#8220;create the right atmosphere.&#8221;
John said he would, although he didn&#8217;t
know what it meant. But Flip didn&#8217;t alone. He
put out all the lights so that there was only the
log fire to keep people from bumping. The flames
really looked like a witch&#8217;s fire, only there were no
witches in the story. Then he heaped cushions on
the floor for Martha Mary to sit on; Flip had
been very polite to Martha Mary since Jane&#8217;s
visit. Walter and Edward Lee lay on their stomachs
on a rug. Liza was the only one who was
not there. Flip piled some lovely-smelling pine
cones on the fire, which sputtered and flamed like
a blacksmith&#8217;s forge, only didn&#8217;t smell at all the
same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, in the days before Mother Dear was
born, or Mother Dear&#8217;s Grandmother, or her
Grandmother&#8217;s Great Grandmother&#8217;s Great
Grandmother, which was many years ago,&#8221; said
Flip, although everyone knew that, &#8220;there lived
a King whose lands were so great that it took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the birds a whole month to fly across them. He
was the richest king who lived in the days of
the fairies. His chests were of the finest gold,
lined with purple satin, and in them were so
many beautiful emeralds and rubies that it would
hurt your eyes to look at them. In his garden
grew the rarest of flowers; roses that had been
brought from England and yellowish brown and
purple orchids from Brazil; iris, lilac, cherry
blossoms, and St. Joseph&#8217;s lilies were there, too,
from all the four corners of the earth. In his
stables there were Arabian horses and splendid
dogs: deerhounds and greyhounds, and had there
been St. Bernards in those days, he no doubt
would have had some of them, too. In the Palace
there were wonderful ancestral paintings,
beautiful furniture, table service of pure gold,
and glass of the rarest cut. Best of all, there
was his very dear Queen Wife and the little
prince who would be King when he grew up. It
was the sunniest of days when the prince came.
The Queen Mother had longed for a son and
heir for a very long time. She dreamed one night
that when the King had grown to love her very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
much she would be given a son; you know, there
can only be children where there is love. The
dream made her more pure and lovely than ever;
her thoughts and her ways so delighted the King
that he learned to love her more than he thought
a mortal could love. And so, just as the rosebush
grows until it is lovely and old and wise
enough to be a mother, and then the seed develops
in it under the petals and finally wins strength
and goes away on the breeze to take root for itself
and become a rose child, so the seed was born
within the Mother Queen. While it was gaining
strength within her, she kept her thought cheerful
and clean, so that when her child came he would
be cheerful and clean always. Then came the sunniest
of days; just the day for a Prince&#8217;s birth,
and early in the morning the King was allowed
to come to his wife&#8217;s room and there, beside
her, on a soft little cushion, was his son, the
Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can well believe that the King was filled
with gladness. He went to the balcony of the
Palace with the tiny baby in his arm and held it
up so that all the subjects could see it. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
cheered and the bronze church bells rang and
there was gladness throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the wisest of the courtiers, guardians
were chosen for the Prince. There was the chief
astrologer to teach him the knowledge that was
in books. The grey-haired old Lord of The Park
taught him the beauty of flowers and the song
of the bird, and the Master of The Whip showed
him the correct way to trot a horse and the manner
in which a King&#8217;s son should hold his sword.
So, surrounded by wealth and the dearest of parents
and the wisest of teachers, Prince Winfred
grew strong and wise. At the time of my story
he was about ten years old, the finest young prince
you have ever seen, only of course you have never
seen a prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would think that, with all his wealth
and splendor, he would be perfectly happy, but
he wasn&#8217;t. You see, one day he was riding down
the Park road on his white horse and he saw
through the Castle gates a farmer&#8217;s boy pass by
on a burro. It was a perfectly good, young grey
burro with a collar of wild flowers and tinkling
bells hanging from it. As soon as Winfred saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
it he knew that he did not have everything in
the world. He made up his mind that he wanted
a burro very much. He told his wish to old Esau,
the astrologer, but Esau raised his hands in horror
and said it would be disgraceful and undignified
for His Grace to ride a burro. He would speak
to the Master of The Whip, he said, and order
new horses. That was not what the Prince wished
for; he had plenty of horses already. He did
not know just why he wanted a burro; personally,
I think I can guess. There was something simple
and modest in the small creature that would have
been a welcome change from the show and pomp
of the Castle. So Winfred went to the Lord
of The Park and told him his desire; that proud
official sneered rather disrespectfully and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Perhaps Your Highness desires a goat, too,
to milk when you tire of the burro.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winfred almost lost his temper, but he remembered
that Princes had to be dignified, so he
went to his father, the King, and in a most proper
fashion, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your Majesty, I have a request to make.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It pleased the King to be asked favors by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
his son, and so he smiled and demanded what it
might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If it please you, Sire,&#8217; said Winfred, &#8216;I
would like a burro.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A burro?&#8217; said the King. &#8216;What will you
do with a burro?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ride him,&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first the King laughed at the idea of seeing
his son and heir astride a donkey, but when
he found that the boy was serious he went into
a rage and Winfred crept away, miserable and
frightened. Out into the Park he went and lay
down under a large oak, where he wept in a
most unprincely manner. He wept until the tears
were smeared all over his silk collar and ran
down his neck. You should have seen him; one
would never have guessed that it was a prince
sprawled there, for all the world like a badly
trained baby. He really was unhappy, though,
so you could not blame him altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;He cried and cried until he heard a rustling
above him in the tree. He looked up, and perched
on a branch just above his head was a small person,
not a great deal larger than a pocket-knife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
It was a girl-person, dressed in bright green,
with the tiniest of green hats on her bit of sunny
hair. She looked down at Winfred and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What do you want?&#8217; demanded Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop crying,&#8217; said the girl-person.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are disrespectful,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I am
the Prince.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t care who you are,&#8217; said the girl-person.
&#8216;I wish you would stop crying.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winfred was so surprised at her lack of respect
that he forgot to cry for a moment, but
he soon began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop it, I say,&#8217; said the little thing. &#8216;Stop
it! I hate you when you do that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winfred cried on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the girl-person commenced to coax.
&#8216;Please,&#8217; she said, &#8216;stop and I will give you any
wish you ask of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why should I stop?&#8217; asked Winfred. &#8216;And
who are you that you can grant wishes to a
prince?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You should stop,&#8217; said the girl-person, &#8216;because
I hate tears, and I can grant wishes, because
I am a fairy.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;&#8216;That is very nice,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I&#8217;ve
always wished to meet a fairy. Are they all like
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Silly,&#8217; said the fairy. &#8216;Of course not. I
am the laughter fairy; I go about the world collecting
children&#8217;s smiles and giving them to solemn
grown-ups. I&#8217;m much nicer than most of the
fairies; I think I am the nicest fairy there ever
was.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You conceited creature,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;You
are not at all nice.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fairy laughed and reached down a tiny
foot and kicked Winfred in the nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t be stupid,&#8217; she said. &#8216;I didn&#8217;t really
mean that. There are other fairies as nice&mdash;almost&mdash;as
I am. And I&#8217;m not a creature and I
wish you wouldn&#8217;t call me one. I&#8217;m a fairy and
my name is&mdash;guess what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Christine,&#8217; guessed Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How silly! Christine is not a fairy name at
all. Christines are always fat and good cooks.
My name is Merrylip. Do you like it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pretty well,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;What does it
mean?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Nothing. It&#8217;s just a name, and names never
mean anything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh!&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;All at once Merrylip commenced to laugh;
laughed so hard that her little foot got tangled
in a spiderweb and she almost ruined the web
getting loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop it,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I can&#8217;t see anything
funny.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are funny,&#8217; said Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why?&#8217; demanded Winfred, and showed
signs of remembering that he was the King&#8217;s son
and entitled to respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Because,&#8217; said Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Because what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Because I asked you to stop crying and I
talked to you a little and you had to stop.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Didn&#8217;t. I stopped because you said you
would grant me a wish.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I forgot,&#8217; said Merrylip. &#8216;What do you
want?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a flash Winfred remembered what he
wanted more than anything else in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please&mdash;a burro,&#8217; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;&#8216;A burro?&#8217; said Merrylip, much surprised.
&#8216;Why in the world do you waste a good
wish on a burro? There are much nicer
things than that to ask for. Wish, why don&#8217;t
you, for heaps of money, and then you can buy
anything!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have plenty of money,&#8217; said Winfred.
&#8216;And all the treasures I want. But a burro is
different. You can&#8217;t just buy them; you have
to be born not a prince to have one. I wish I
was a train-engineer or a policeman or a farmhand.
A prince has so many duties that it is tiresome.
When I am King I shall have a whole
stable full of burros.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then you won&#8217;t enjoy them at all,&#8217; said
Merrylip. She was really wise for such a small
fairy. &#8216;You&#8217;ll get tired of them. People always
do when they have finally got what they wanted
very much.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I am different.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I bet you,&#8217; said Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bet what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bet I will show you something nicer than
a burro; even nicer than two burros. You&#8217;ll be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
perfectly happy for two hours&mdash;then you&#8217;ll want
to be a prince again and forget everything
else.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You just say that because you are a girl,&#8217;
said Winfred. &#8216;Girls never understand boys.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll prove it,&#8217; said Merrylip. &#8216;Come under
my cape.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I&#8217;m too big.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That is easy,&#8217; said Merrylip. &#8216;You must kiss
me on my ear, then see what happens.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kisses are horrid,&#8217; said Winfred. Still he
was not going to take any chances of not having
his wish, so he reached up and just put the smallest
kind of a kiss on Merrylip&#8217;s ear. It tasted
like marshmallows. As soon as he touched her,
Winfred began to grow small. You have never
seen a boy as small as he became&mdash;about so big.
Then he climbed up and drew Merrylip&#8217;s cape over
him and away they went. Up over the very tops
of the trees, out across the Castle wall, down into
the valley, pop over a stream, high again so as
not to bump into a fat old oak, and&mdash;before you
knew it&mdash;they were right above the city. Far below
them were the people, walking about, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
they didn&#8217;t, any of them, look larger than Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now,&#8217; said Merrylip. &#8216;Be ready!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down they swooped right to the middle of
the street, where a whole dozen children were
playing London Bridges. They were rather dirty
children; their clothes were not at all nice and
their hair was mussed. As soon as the Prince&#8217;s
feet touched the cobblestones, he became his natural
size. Merrylip disappeared altogether, but
Winfred heard her buzzing about his ear, telling
him what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can imagine how surprised all the children
were when they found that a strange boy
had popped up out of nowhere. They gathered
around him and shouted, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winfred was going to say, &#8216;The King&#8217;s Son,&#8217;
but Merrylip whispered in his ear, so he just
said, &#8216;Winfred.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The children didn&#8217;t care very much who he
was, after all. You see, Merrylip had touched
his clothes with her lavender stick and they had
become old and dirty just like those of the others.
They decided that they would start another game:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Rum-ba-loo-pum-ba-loo. The oldest of them
counted out loud:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Eny, meny, miny, mo. Catch a fairy by the
toe. If he hollers let him go. Fairy, meny, miny,
mo. O-U-T spells out, with the Old Mother
Witch&#8217;s hat turned in&mdash;side&mdash;out.&#8217; And Winfred
was out.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I don&#8217;t know how to play,&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s perfectly easy!&#8217; they shouted. &#8216;You
know, the one who is out is It.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How can you be It if you are Out?&#8217; asked
Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t explain, but that was the way
it was played. The one who was Out was It, and
he or she was called Mrs. Rumbaloopumbaloo.
She had to be the old witch and live on a stump of
a tree. That was all the home she had. Then
the children came up and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mother Rumbaloopumbaloo, what are you
thinking of?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rumbaloopumbaloo would say the first letter
of the word. If it was ice cream, she would
say &#8216;I&#8217;; if it was music, she would say &#8216;M,&#8217; and
so on. Then, if one of the children guessed right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Mother Rumbaloopumbaloo would chase them all
and the one who was caught was It.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to Winfred came the children and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mother Rumbaloopumbaloo, what are you
thinking of?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It begins with B,&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Books,&#8217; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nope.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bells?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nope.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Beans?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then a little girl, whom no one had noticed
before, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know. It&#8217;s a burro.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Uhu!&#8217; shouted Winfred, and chased them
down the street. He caught the little girl who
had guessed rightly and whispered to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How did you know?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Silly, silly,&#8217; said the girl, for it was Merrylip,
grown big.</p>

<p>&#8220;They played for a very long time, and Winfred
was never so happy before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Isn&#8217;t this nicer than a burro?&#8217; asked Merrylip,
and Winfred said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A thousand times nicer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;After a while they all were tired and didn&#8217;t
think the game was fun any more, so they took
up their hats and started for home.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You can come home with me for lunch if
you want,&#8217; said one of the boys to Winfred. Winfred
whispered to Merrylip, and she said he might,
so they went. Only Merrylip made herself small
again and hid in the Prince&#8217;s pocket. They came
to a small hut, and the boy, whose name was
Michael, rushed in with Winfred after him. They
threw their hats on a chair and shouted, and in
came a woman, all fat and grey, with a gingham
apron. Michael jumped into her arms and
shouted: &#8216;Mother, I&#8217;ve brought a boy to lunch.
His name is Winfred.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fat Mother kissed Winfred; then they
sat down in the kitchen and had oodles of beans
and black bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Isn&#8217;t this nicer than burros?&#8217; whispered Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A thousand times nicer,&#8217; whispered Winfred.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;&#8216;And nicer than dinner at home with servants
all about?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A thousand times nicer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When they couldn&#8217;t eat any more, the old
Mother went to sleep in her chair, and Winfred
said good-by to Michael and went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where now?&#8217; he asked Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now the best of all,&#8217; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down the road they went to a large field,
where a grey burro was eating grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Get on,&#8217; said Merrylip. Winfred patted the
burro on the nose, then climbed up. Away they
went, much faster than burros usually travel, rushing
across the fields till the wind hummed about
Winfred&#8217;s ears like music. They galloped up
across the hills and down into new grass valleys
that Winfred had never seen before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Isn&#8217;t this nice?&#8217; shouted Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There is nothing nicer in the world!&#8217; Winfred
shouted back.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Silly,&#8217; said Merrylip.</p>

<p>&#8220;On and on they rode until Winfred grew
tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I would like to stop, now.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;Immediately the burro disappeared and Winfred
was standing under a tree, with Merrylip
next to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where do you want to go now?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m hungry,&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Shall we go to the old Mother&#8217;s and have
more beans?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;d rather have fried chicken and strawberries,&#8217;
said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But the old Mother only eats beans.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can eat at home,&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m tired of burros.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t you want to go back and play with
the children?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, they were dirty and disrespectful.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are horrid,&#8217; said Merrylip. &#8216;But I knew
you would be this way.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;She thought a moment, frowning the tiniest,
most adorable frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, &#8216;I hate boys,&#8217; she said, &#8216;especially selfish
ones. I am going to punish you for growing
tired so quickly of the things you wanted more
than anything else in the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;All at once there came a rush of wind, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Winfred was alone, and, to his horror, as tiny as
a string bean.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Merrylip!&#8217; he called. &#8216;Don&#8217;t leave me
alone! I am frightened.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again he called: &#8216;I can&#8217;t go home if you
don&#8217;t come! My feet are so small and my legs so
tiny that I never would get there!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still there was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;So how do you think he got home?&#8221;</p>

<p>None of the children could guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Flip, &#8220;it is nine o&#8217;clock and you
all ought to be in bed. So I&#8217;m not going to tell
you another word, and there will be a second
chapter to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please!&#8221; the children all shouted.
&#8220;We want to know now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word,&#8221; said Flip.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Walter sprang on to Flip&#8217;s
stomach and Edward Lee sat on his face and
Walter shouted for help. John got a rope, and
with the aid of Martha Mary they tied Flip to
the leg of the library table. The noise was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
terrific. In rushed Mother Dear and Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here!&#8221; said Father. &#8220;What is the
noise about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Martha Mary, &#8220;Walter is a
hero and Flip is a villain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mother Dear laughed, and when Mother
laughs Father always laughs, too. It really is
quite funny to see Mother laugh. She is becoming
just the least bit stout. Well, when Father
laughed, the children jumped on him, too, and
tied him to another leg of the table. Father tried
to look scandalized, but you could see a laugh
lurking out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>Said he, &#8220;I consider this very undignified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;it is jail. You have to
give bail before you can get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And may I ask how much the bail is?&#8221; asked
Father, digging his hand into his money pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that kind of a bail,&#8221; said Edward Lee.
&#8220;Mother Dear, what shall the bail be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Dear had a splendid idea. &#8220;We&#8217;ll punish
Father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;by making Flip sing, and
punish Flip by making Father sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father did not want to, but the children would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
not let him go, so he sang in an awful, awful
voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first1">&#8220;There once was a silly old whale</div>
<div class="verse">Who drowned himself in a pail.</div>
<div class="verse">Amongst folks it is said</div>
<div class="verse">There was room for his head,</div>
<div class="verse">But not the least bit for his tail.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; moaned Flip. &#8220;Spare me, spare
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they spared him, but made him sing to
torture Father. Then it was the most surprising
thing. He sang in the softest, nicest voice, a
voice that just seemed to fit in with the firelight
and the &#8220;atmosphere&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first1">&#8220;Way up above the blackest trees that tease the sky at night</div>
<div class="verse">A million young star children dance a merry, fairy dance.</div>
<div class="verse">The fat old moon comes through the clouds and giggles with delight</div>
<div class="verse">To see the myriad youngsters as they skip and hop and prance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, when the night is growing old and skies are fading grey</div>
<div class="verse">A mother star comes softly out a lullaby to hum.</div>
<div class="verse">She warns the dancing children of the coming of the day,</div>
<div class="verse">For a very careful Mother is Mrs. Rumdidoodledum.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Then the children looked out of the window and,
sure enough, Lady Rumdidoodledum was just appearing,
big and bright, above the pine trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flip,&#8221; coaxed Martha Mary, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think
you could tell us just a bit of how Winfred got
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow night,&#8221; said Flip, and so everyone
said good night and went to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>IN WHICH WINFRED IS GIVEN THE MOST WONDERFUL<br />
WISH IN THE WORLD, AND I ADVISE YOU<br />
ALL TO READ IT AND LEARN WHAT IT IS, SO<br />
THAT IF, SOME DAY WHEN YOU ARE LEAST EXPECTING<br />
IT, A FAIRY COMES AND OFFERS YOU<br />
A WISH, YOU WILL KNOW FOR WHAT TO ASK</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following day came a surprise for the
children. While they were at their lessons Mother
Dear constantly looked at her watch and then
gazed out of the window. Martha Mary was sure
something was going to happen, but she could
not for a moment imagine what it was to be.
Finally Mother Dear could keep the secret no
longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Babes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you may all put away your
books, and then I have something to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it nice?&#8221; asked Edward Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and no,&#8221; said Mother. &#8220;I want you to
be happy about it and be nice to Flip. You
see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>Martha Mary&#8217;s lips began to tremble. She
came to Mother and hid her face in her lap so
that the boys could not see her eyes. Mother
Dear smoothed the long curls that fell over
Martha Mary&#8217;s shoulders and patted her cheeks,
just as you would a baby&#8217;s. The boys did not
know what to think.</p>

<p>Finally Martha Mary looked up and smiled the
most unhappy little smile imaginable, because
it was hard to make-believe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I just knew it had to
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Dear?&#8221; asked Mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is going away; I am sure he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Dear&#8217;s eyes were all watery. &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but you must not be selfish. Flip is
going to be very, very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is the Jane-person,&#8221; grunted
John.</p>

<p>Mother Dear frowned a little and then smiled
a perfectly good smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Jane-person,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I am
happy as happy can be. You see, Flip has received
a great deal of money for his book and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
the publisher wants him to come to New York to
discuss the work he is to do from now on. And
so Flip is going&mdash;going in a few weeks, but first
he is going to the City and he and Jane are to
be married, and John and Martha Mary are going
with Father and myself to the wedding. So, you
see, it is to be nice, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Liza, &#8220;isn&#8217;t my Flip ever, ever
going to come back no more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Butterfly! In much less than a
year he will return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not. But he is
to have a lovely cottage just a short distance down
the road and&mdash;&mdash; Ssh! Flip is coming. I want
you to be very nice to him and not say anything
about what I have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flip came in with a perfectly happy smile. Immediately
he saw that something was wrong. The
children were always more noisy when he came.
But he looked at Mother Dear and she nodded,
so he pretended to notice nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Supposing we
find out now what happened to Winfred.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; the children shouted, forgetting for
the moment that it might be the last story he
would tell them in a long time. (Personally, I
know that it wasn&#8217;t.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Flip (he always said &#8220;Well&#8221;
when he started to speak), &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, and
please, Martha Mary, will you sit on my knee
just this once while I tell it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Mary came and climbed to his knee
just like a baby and hid her face in his big coat,
because she was afraid of crying. Then Flip
coughed to clear his throat and told the second
chapter of Winfred&#8217;s story:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let me see! Winfred was standing in
the middle of the field, alone, and he was no
larger than a string bean. Every time a small
breeze came along it picked him up, just like
a leaf, and carried him to another part of the
field. That was rather good fun at first, but after
a while it was unpleasant to have to fly whether
you would or not. So Winfred crept under a
wild rosebush and hid in the leaves, where he could
think without being disturbed. But thinking did
not do any good, for that would not make him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
large again. He sat with his tiny face in his
hands and frowned. Then the sky grew dark
and it was night. Lady Rumdidoodledum and
thousands of star children came into the sky and
the moon appeared like the largest gold plate you
have ever seen. Soon voices were heard in the
field&mdash;voices of people calling and shouting,
&#8216;Prince Winfred!&#8217; They were the guards seeking
the lost boy. They tramped here and there and
everywhere and could not hear when Winfred
answered them, for his voice was as small as his
body. Once a guard came along, swinging a blue
lantern, and he almost stepped on Winfred.
Finally they said he could not be in that field,
so they went ahead, the men shouting and blowing
trumpets, and the women calling and moaning.
Last of all came the Queen Mother. She
did not speak or cry, but walked with her head
bowed and tears in her eyes. Winfred held out
his arms and called, &#8216;Mother Dearest!&#8217; but she
could not see or hear him. And so she passed out
of sight with the others. Then Winfred crept
out from the wild rosebush and commenced to
climb the hill. It was a hard climb for his short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
legs and he was very much out of breath when
he reached the top. He rested a moment and
then looked down. Far below him he saw the
ocean, grey and cold, and very great, reaching
all the way to the shores of Japan. Along the
beach the huge waves splashed like white horses.
The winds came skipping across the waters,
mussing them in all directions. Winfred gasped,
for he had never seen the ocean before. Then,
suddenly, he remembered&mdash;(and this is true, I assure
you) the first time you see or do anything,
such as eating the first grape of the season, or
seeing the first firefly, or anything like that, if
you make a wish it is sure to come true. So
Winfred reached out his arms to the sea and
whispered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;Oh, ocean blue, oh, ocean grey,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ve never seen you before to-day.</div>
<div class="verse">Grant to me, oh, grant, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">The wish I wish to you to-day.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Out of the wildest of the waves skipped a
tiny veil of blue, waving and swaying across the
sky like a bit of smoke. Straight to Winfred it
came and fluttered to his feet. Then he saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
it was a sprite, a tiny blue one, no larger than himself.
The water sprite was dressed like a Queen&#8217;s
page, all golden and blue, and he carried the
smallest imaginable trumpet in his hand. He took
off his hat and bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Prince Winfred,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I have come from
the salty sea with a message for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I saw you coming,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I should
think you would lose your breath when you travel
through the water.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;One does,&#8217; said the sprite, &#8216;if one keeps one&#8217;s
mouth open. But I breathe through my ears.
Why don&#8217;t you try it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Winfred tried, but he couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please,&#8217; he said, &#8216;what is your message?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am Lovelight, the messenger of King Neptune
who rules the ocean,&#8217; said the sprite. &#8216;King
Neptune&#8217; (he said &#8216;King&#8217; like &#8216;kink&#8217;) &#8216;heard
your wish and he says that he will grant it, because
he likes to have people believe in him. What
will you wish?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; said Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait!&#8217; said Lovelight. &#8216;Don&#8217;t be silly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
wish for something that is not worth while. And,
for Goodness&#8217; Sake, don&#8217;t wish for a burro!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How did you know about that?&#8217; asked Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, as soon as Merrylip left you she came
straight to the sea to tell all the waves and collect
laughs from them. When they heard that
a King&#8217;s Son had asked for a burro, they laughed
so hard that the sailors all thought a storm was
coming up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I could choke Merrylip,&#8217; said Winfred, although
he laughed himself. &#8216;But,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;I do not know how to make a worth-while
wish.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovelight came close and put his lips to Winfred&#8217;s
ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There is one wish,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that is more
wonderful than anything else in the world. Shall
I tell it to you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Please do!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, wish that any wish you make at any
time, as long as it is sensible, will come true. You
see, that is really only one wish.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And will it come true?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Certainly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So again Winfred looked out to the sea and
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8216;Oh, ocean blue, oh, ocean grey,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ve never seen you before to-day.</div>
<div class="verse">Grant to me, oh, grant, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">The wish I wish to you to-day!&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Then he added: &#8216;I wish that any wish I make
at any time will come true as long as it is
sensible.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When he stopped, a golden light ran across
the waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You see,&#8217; said Lovelight, &#8216;Neptune is smiling.
He says he will grant your wish. Try
once!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All right,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I wish that Merrylip
would come back.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost immediately Merrylip came skipping
through the grass, with her golden hair waving
in the moonlight. Winfred put his arms about
her and kissed her on the nose. &#8216;Please,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;I wish, Merrylip, that you would not think me
hateful any more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Smile, Silly!&#8217; said Merrylip. &#8216;And I won&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;So Winfred smiled and that part of his trouble
was ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now,&#8217; said Lovelight, &#8216;I must return to King
Neptune.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wish you a pleasant journey back,&#8217; said
Winfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thanks,&#8217; said Lovelight, and skipped into the
sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wish you would give the King my regards,&#8217;
Winfred called after him, and Lovelight had a
pleasant journey and gave the King Winfred&#8217;s
regards as soon as he arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now,&#8217; said Merrylip, &#8216;I don&#8217;t suppose you
will have any more to do with me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I will,&#8217; said Winfred. &#8216;I don&#8217;t suppose
you will have any more to do with me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t really mean it to be a wish, although
he wanted it very much, but he forgot
that every time he said &#8216;I wish&#8217; it would come
true. So Merrylip stayed and that is why, even
when he grew up and was King, Winfred always
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Next on the programme is Home,&#8217; said Winfred.
&#8216;I wish I was my regular size and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
sitting on Mother&#8217;s lap and she was singing to me,
and Merrylip was hiding in my pocket, and things
were just as though I had never gone away at
all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost before he had finished the very long
sentence, it came true. Winfred found himself
on his Mother&#8217;s knee (although he was a pretty
big boy to be held that way) and she was pressing
her lips on his hair and humming him a Queen
Song. In his pocket slept Merrylip and no one
knew it excepting Winfred, because she was so
tiny that, even when she sneezed, people could
not hear her. And so everything came out well,
after all, you see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Later, Winfred grew to be King, and with his
wonderful wish made his people the happiest on
earth, for when anything sensible had to be arranged
he needed but to wish and it would come
true. As a matter of fact, it was fortunate that
Merrylip was always there, for often he thought of
silly wishes and then Merrylip would pinch his
ear and he would not make them. And this is
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is a relief to know that he got home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
all right,&#8221; said John. John was forming the
habit of using long words. It would have been
just as easy for him to say &#8220;glad&#8221; as &#8220;relief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Martha Mary climbed off Flip&#8217;s knee,
and he held her hands and she leaned forward and
whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry as sorry can be, Flip Dear, that
you are going away, but I am happy because you
and Jane will be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Flip smiled and gazed out of the window, and
then took Martha Mary into his arms and kissed
her, and the boys all shouted, and Martha Mary
rushed from the room, all red and happy.</p>

<p>And so Flip told the last but one of his stories
before he went to New York, and, as you shall
see, the last one I had nothing to do with.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>IN WHICH, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME,<br />
I DO NOT TALK AT ALL, BUT AM WELL CONTENT<br />
TO SIT QUIETLY BY AND LISTEN TO THE<br />
LOVELY NEWS THAT L. H. D., WHO, YOU WILL<br />
REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU ABOUT IN THE PREFACE,<br />
HAS BROUGHT</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> gloriously sunny morning Liza opened her
grey eyes wide, yawned, and decided that she
would really stay awake and consider the business
of the day. She sat up in her little crib,
looking adorably pink and white and very huggable,
with her tousled golden curls playing hide
and seek with each other on her neck. Across the
room, in her own bed, still sound asleep, lay
Martha Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister Lazy Bones,&#8221; thought Butterfly, and
wondered how anyone could want to sleep when
Mr. Cock Robin was singing such a splendid
song in the vines at the windows. Liza looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
around the room expectantly, then the corners
of her mouth drooped pitifully, and a big tear
rolled down her cheek. For where was Mother
Dear this beautiful morning? Never before, as
long as Liza could remember, had she failed to find
Mother bending over her when she awakened, with
a big kiss waiting in the corner of her mouth for
her baby daughter.</p>

<p>Just at that minute, luckily, Nurse Huggins
came in, smiling, oh, so happily! Liza, of course,
just couldn&#8217;t help smiling, too, though she had not
any idea at all why she was so glad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said she, &#8220;where&#8217;s my Muvver
Dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>(She never took time to say Mother quite distinctly,
though she really could if she wanted
to.)</p>

<p>Nurse just laughed mysteriously, in the annoying
way that grown-ups sometimes have, kissed the
little Butterfly, and bade her get quickly into her
wrapper and slippers. By this time Martha Mary
was awake, too, and following Liza&#8217;s example.
In another moment the two children were standing
before Mother Dear&#8217;s door, which was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
quietly opened from the inside by a brown-eyed
lady, dressed all in white, whom they had never
seen before. Mother lay in the big, four-poster
bed, looking a little pale and a little tired, but
oh, so &#8220;smily.&#8221; Right next to her was a little
cradle, all blue lace and ribbons, and inside&mdash; Guess
what! There was a baby, a teeny, tiny bit
of a one, all red and wrinkled, and not half so big
as Liza&#8217;s doll. At first Martha Mary could only
look from the big bed to the cradle and then
back again. Then, when they realized what a
wonderful present Mother Dear had given them,
they nearly smothered her with kisses. No one
said a word, because, you see, when a person is
really and truly happy they can&#8217;t talk much because
of the choky feeling in their throat. But
after Martha Mary and Liza had each touched the
crumpled rose-leaf hands of the new baby, and
looked into its tiny face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;is it a sister or a
brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother laughed, then,&mdash;she just couldn&#8217;t help
it. How silly she had been not to have told
them!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sister, Ladykin Dear,&#8221; said Father, who
came into the room just in time to hear the question.
&#8220;And she is just as glad to see you as you
are to see her, only she sleeps so much that she
hasn&#8217;t time to tell you so, herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Father was speaking Liza&#8217;s eyes had
grown very wide indeed, for the tiny sister had
yawned, then opened her eyes, and was looking
straight at Liza.</p>

<p>&#8220;Muvver Dear! Father!&#8221; said she excitedly,
&#8220;she is going to talk to me.&#8221; Then Butterfly&#8217;s
golden curls, which just reached to the top of
the cradle, bent over anxiously toward the little
bald head of the new baby. No one spoke for
at least a minute, which was evidently long enough
for Miss Little Sister to deliver her message, for
at the end of that time, away flew Liza across the
room like a little sunbeam, dancing and singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first1">&#8220;I know a secret I won&#8217;t tell you,</div>
<div class="verse">Sister told me and it is true.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>No amount of begging on the part of Martha
Mary could persuade Liza to tell what the little
stranger had said. I am sorry to say that Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
felt just the least bit jealous, for she didn&#8217;t see
why Liza should be the only person in the family
to know such wonderful things. Just as the two
children were leaving the room, Liza went over to
the big bed, took Mother Dear&#8217;s hand and
kissed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baby says her name&#8217;s &#8216;Midge,&#8217;&#8221; said Butterfly.
&#8220;That is part of the secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone smiled and was glad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Father, &#8220;Midge it shall be, although
her really, truly name is to be &#8216;Margaret,&#8217;
just like Mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Liza&#8217;s eyes fairly danced with delight at the
news, and Martha Mary had to keep a very tight
hold on her lips, so as not to shout how happy she
was, and so awaken Miss Midge.</p>

<p>No one could seem to eat any breakfast that
morning, though there were delicious berries from
the garden, with mush, and new-laid eggs, and
the thickest cream that Cow Bess could give.
The boys had been introduced to Miss Margaret
Sherman, the second, while Liza and Martha
Mary were dressing, so it was small wonder that
with the new addition to the family to discuss the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
importance of such an every-day occurrence as
breakfast faded to almost nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not so much,&#8221; said Walter, with a rather
disgusted look, while he balanced a raspberry
on the end of his fork. &#8220;Little bit of a red thing
without any hair at all! and, do you know, it
hasn&#8217;t even a single tooth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, supposing it hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said John, his
pride very much hurt at the idea of a sister of
his not being perfect, &#8220;it&#8217;s much happier without
them, I&#8217;m sure. Doesn&#8217;t have to bother with any
old dentist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John! Walter! How can you?&#8221; said Martha
Mary, almost in tears. &#8220;You are simply
hateful to talk like that about the loveliest baby
there ever was. You ask Miss Mason if she
isn&#8217;t. I heard her tell Father that Midge was a
&#8216;perfectly normal child,&#8217; and although it sounds
awful, he looked so happy that I know it must
be something nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where did she come from, my Sister
Midge Margaret?&#8221; said Liza, who had been perfectly
still ever since she had left Mother Dear&#8217;s
room. No one knew, but Edward Lee suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
that they find Flip, and perhaps he could tell
them. So away they all scampered, but not a
trace of him could they find. Just as they were
about to give up, Liza spied him way down in
the sunken garden, his arms full of baby roses
which he had gathered for the baby in the house
who looked so like a rose herself. The children
had never before seen him look so happy, except
the day that Jane came and his book was accepted.
So, of course, they knew it would be easy to get
him to tell a story. Martha Mary took his hand
and patted it and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Flip, we would like a really and truly
story about Margaret.&#8221; Flip was delighted and
said he had intended to tell one, anyway, and
was coming to look for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I am very, very happy to-day,
Ladykin Dear, so you shall have the nicest
story I know how to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this is what he told them&mdash;the story of
Little Sister Margaret:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever wonder, Children,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;when you look at the sky at night, and see the
millions of fairy stars twinkling and dancing up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
there, just why they are so bright and happy?
Well, I&#8217;ll tell you the reason. It is the most
wonderfullest secret there ever was, and the only
people who are allowed to know it are the ones
who love the star children very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Liza. &#8220;Please tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too&mdash;and Me&mdash;and Me&mdash;and Me,&#8221; came
in chorus from the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Flip continued, &#8220;you all know that
everybody and everything in the world must have
some use, no matter how little it may be. It is
just the same in Star-land, though most silly
people never think what the little twinkling lights
are for. Do you know that every single one of
them, down to the teeniest, tiniest baby, that you
can hardly see, is a world of loveliness all by
itself? There is the Rose Star, where gloriously
deep red roses, and little shy yellow buds and
pink lady-roses grow, and the air is sweeter than
the sweetest perfume you can imagine. Then
there is the Forget-me-not Star, all covered with
the little blue flowers that look like Sister Margaret&#8217;s
eyes; and the Violet Star, and Pansy
Land, and Sun Flower Place (very large and important)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
and heaps and heaps of other flower
stars whose names I have forgotten. Of course
there is Fairy Story Star, too, where Puss in
Boots, and Little Red Riding Hood, and Cinderella,
and Jack the Giant Killer, and all the rest of
them live. Right near IT is the Grown-Up Book
Star, where there are so very many people that
they never get time to know each other. But the
most important star, outside, of course, of the
Music Land Star and the Bird Star where the
loveliest of songs come from, and really, even
more important than them, is&mdash;guess who! Butterfly
Dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Rumdidoodledum,&#8221; said Liza, without
even stopping to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Flip, &#8220;and that is just whom I
am going to tell you about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought it was to be about baby sister,&#8221;
said Martha Mary, rather disappointedly, for
she really could think of nothing else this morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is about them both, Impatient,&#8221; answered
Flip.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, since Lady Rumdidoodledum is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
biggest and brightest and happiest star of them
all, she must of course have something very nice
to make her so glad. Now, what do you suppose
it would be that is even lovelier than all the
loveliest flowers or books, or birds, or anything
else that you can think of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give up,&#8221; said Walter, although everyone
was much too busy listening to Flip to pay any
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Martha Mary, her eyes shining.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, Ladykin Dear,&#8221; answered Flip.
&#8220;Lady Rumdidoodledum is the Baby Star, and
she shines specially for little children all over
the world. I must tell you about her. There are
oodles and oodles of babies living there, creeping
and laughing and cooing all day. They are
happy as happy can be, for they have the most
adorable little playmates that you ever saw.
They are little fairy creatures, scarcely as large
as Martha Mary&#8217;s finger-nails, and they live in the
soft, silky green centers of eucalyptus blossoms.
When a Mother down here on the earth wants a
little boy child or girl child very badly, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
goes out into the woods and picks a eucalyptus
blossom. Then, if she is very wise she opens it,
whispers her wish, and lets out the tiny creature
inside, who flies away up beyond the clouds in
the gentle arms of the Southeast wind, straight
to Lady Rumdidoodledum. There, the first thing
the little fairy-person sees is a big silver cloud.
She goes right through it, for she is both a fairy
and a dream and can do many wonderful things.
Right there, who do you think is waiting? A
smiling Mother-person who looks like your Mother
Dear, as well as every other Mother in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Happy Day, Little Dream,&#8217; she says, which
is Rumdidoodledum for &#8216;How do you do?&#8217; The
little creature whispers the message of the Mother
who sent her from earth, then flies back to
tell her that all is well, and her wish will be
granted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one lovely evening, several months ago,
just after the sun had set and the sky was all
rosy and gold in the west, your Mother Dear
went out for a little walk in the garden with
Father. Lady Rumdidoodledum had just come
out and was shining very brightly over the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of the big eucalyptus tree. Mother Dear saw her
first; she always does, you know. So, she wished
very, very hard for another little daughter, at
the same time opening the eucalyptus blossom
that she held in her hand. There was a little
breeze at that moment, and away flew the tiny
creature. When she reached the Baby Star, she
stayed a very, very long time indeed. For she
was most particular for so small a personage and
wished to find just the very sweetest of all the
Rumdidoodledum babies to be Margaret Sherman.
So she searched and searched but none of
them suited exactly, until way off in a corner she
found what she was looking for: an adorable
little golden-haired mite with eyes that danced
and were the color of forget-me-nots. Then the
fairy-person knew that she had found the right
little sister for John, Martha Mary, Walter and
Edward Lee and Liza, so she flew off, happy as
happy could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since, Mother Dear has been waiting,
waiting for her dream to come true. This morning,
just as Lady Rumdidoodledum was fading
from the sky, the Baby-person arrived, for all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the world as lovely and pink as the dawn that
brought her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, Butterfly Dear, is the story of Little
Sister Margaret, the dearest of all Lady Rumdidoodledum&#8217;s
children. And that, you see, is the
reason that Mr. Cock Robin sang so happily outside
your window this morning and the flowers
were all so gay and the sky so blue and bright.
You see, all the world is happy at the sound of
a baby&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, there she is, calling now, for someone
to come and love her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Butterfly Liza. &#8220;And I&mdash;and I&mdash;and
I&mdash;and I,&#8221; sang all the others.</p>

<p class="center">By EDMUND LEAMY</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Illustrated. Small 4to, cloth. Net $1.00</i></b></p>


<p>&#8220;&#8216;<b>The Golden Spears and Other Fairy Tales</b>&#8217; is a book of absorbing
interest for children, and will be read with pleasure by
grown-up people. It is by the Irish writer, Edmund Leamy, who
understood the child nature and loved to minister to it. The delight
which children have in the world of fields and flowers, birds
and blue skies, finds abundant expression in the stories. In each
tale the dramatic feature is well developed and holds the reader&#8217;s
interest to the end. The book has real literary merit, the author&#8217;s
style being graceful and well adapted to the child mind. There are
not enough such books in the world. Books that are free from
objectionable features and meet the child&#8217;s craving for the wonderful,
at the same time portraying the beautiful and noble in the world and
in human life, are very rare. Brightness, beauty, nobility of sentiment,
brave deeds, generous conduct, kindness, gratitude, fidelity,
appreciation of the good and true in humanity, kindness to the lower
orders of life, purity of thought, all find abundant expression in the
stories. There are seven of them in the volume. Each has an attractive
illustration drawn by Corinne Turner. They are printed on
paper of an excellent quality and handsomely bound in cloth, with
an appropriate cover design in colors. Educators would do well
to consider this volume as well adapted to meet the need for suitable
reading matter in certain school grades.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Springfield Republican.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
